# Language Server Protocol Base Specification - 3.17

This document describes the upcoming 3.17.x version of the base language server protocol structures and interactions. An implementation for node of the 3.17.x version of all components of the protocol can be found [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-languageserver-node).

**Note:** edits to this specification can be made via a pull request against this markdown [document](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol/blob/gh-pages/_specifications/specification-base.md).

## <a href="#whatIsNew" name="whatIsNew" class="anchor"> What's new in 3.17 </a>

All new 3.17 features and are tagged with version 3.17 text or in JSDoc using `@since 3.17.0` annotation. Major new feature are:

- None so far.

A detailed list of the changes can be found in each sections the [change log](#version_3_17_0)

The version of the specification is used to group features into a new specification release and to refer to their first appearance. Features in the spec are kept compatible using so called capability flags which are exchanged between the client and the server during initialization.

## <a href="#specs" name="specs" class="anchor"> Specs </a>

This document describes a base tooling protocol. These are the specs that utilize and expand on this base protocol:

- [Language Server Protocol (LSP)](/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/specification-3-17)

## <a href="#baseProtocol" name="baseProtocol" class="anchor"> Base Protocol </a>

The base protocol consists of a header and a content part (comparable to HTTP). The header and content part are
separated by a '\r\n'.

### <a href="#headerPart" name="headerPart" class="anchor"> Header Part </a>

The header part consists of header fields. Each header field is comprised of a name and a value, separated by ': ' (a colon and a space). The structure of header fields conform to the [HTTP semantic](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2). Each header field is terminated by '\r\n'. Considering the last header field and the overall header itself are each terminated with '\r\n', and that at least one header is mandatory, this means that two '\r\n' sequences always immediately precede the content part of a message.

Currently the following header fields are supported:

| Header Field Name | Value Type  | Description |
|:------------------|:------------|:------------|
| Content-Length    | number      | The length of the content part in bytes. This header is required. |
| Content-Type      | string      | The mime type of the content part. Defaults to application/vscode-jsonrpc; charset=utf-8 |
{: .table .table-bordered .table-responsive}

The header part is encoded using the 'ascii' encoding. This includes the '\r\n' separating the header and content part.

### <a href="#contentPart" name="contentPart" class="anchor"> Content Part </a>

Contains the actual content of the message. The content part of a message uses [JSON-RPC](http://www.jsonrpc.org/) to describe requests, responses and notifications. The content part is encoded using the charset provided in the Content-Type field. It defaults to `utf-8`, which is the only encoding supported right now. If a server or client receives a header with a different encoding than `utf-8` it should respond with an error.

(Prior versions of the protocol used the string constant `utf8` which is not a correct encoding constant according to [specification](http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets/character-sets.xhtml).) For backwards compatibility it is highly recommended that a client and a server treats the string `utf8` as `utf-8`.

### Example:

```
Content-Length: ...\r\n
\r\n
{
	"jsonrpc": "2.0",
	"id": 1,
	"method": "textDocument/didOpen",
	"params": {
		...
	}
}
```
### <a href="#baseProtocolJsonStructures" name="regExp" class="anchor"> Base Protocol JSON structures </a>

The following TypeScript definitions describe the base [JSON-RPC protocol](http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification):

#### <a href="#number" name="number" class="anchor"> Numbers </a>

The protocol use the following definitions for integers, unsigned integers and decimal numbers:

```typescript
/**
 * Defines an integer number in the range of -2^31 to 2^31 - 1.
 */
export type integer = number;
```

```typescript
/**
 * Defines an unsigned integer number in the range of 0 to 2^31 - 1.
 */
export type uinteger = number;
```

```typescript
/**
 * Defines a decimal number. Since decimal numbers are very
 * rare in the language server specification we denote the
 * exact range with every decimal using the mathematics
 * interval notation (e.g. [0, 1] denotes all decimals d with
 * 0 <= d <= 1.
 */
export type decimal = number;
```

#### Abstract Message

A general message as defined by JSON-RPC. The language server protocol always uses "2.0" as the `jsonrpc` version.

```typescript
interface Message {
	jsonrpc: string;
}
```
#### <a href="#requestMessage" name="requestMessage" class="anchor"> Request Message </a>

A request message to describe a request between the client and the server. Every processed request must send a response back to the sender of the request.

```typescript
interface RequestMessage extends Message {

	/**
	 * The request id.
	 */
	id: integer | string;

	/**
	 * The method to be invoked.
	 */
	method: string;

	/**
	 * The method's params.
	 */
	params?: array | object;
}
```

#### <a href="#responseMessage" name="responseMessage" class="anchor"> Response Message </a>

A Response Message sent as a result of a request. If a request doesn't provide a result value the receiver of a request still needs to return a response message to conform to the JSON RPC specification. The result property of the ResponseMessage should be set to `null` in this case to signal a successful request.

```typescript
interface ResponseMessage extends Message {
	/**
	 * The request id.
	 */
	id: integer | string | null;

	/**
	 * The result of a request. This member is REQUIRED on success.
	 * This member MUST NOT exist if there was an error invoking the method.
	 */
	result?: string | number | boolean | object | null;

	/**
	 * The error object in case a request fails.
	 */
	error?: ResponseError;
}

interface ResponseError {
	/**
	 * A number indicating the error type that occurred.
	 */
	code: integer;

	/**
	 * A string providing a short description of the error.
	 */
	message: string;

	/**
	 * A primitive or structured value that contains additional
	 * information about the error. Can be omitted.
	 */
	data?: string | number | boolean | array | object | null;
}

export namespace ErrorCodes {
	// Defined by JSON RPC
	export const ParseError: integer = -32700;
	export const InvalidRequest: integer = -32600;

	 *
	 * @since 3.16.0
	 */
	export const jsonrpcReservedErrorRangeStart: integer = -32099;
	/** @deprecated use jsonrpcReservedErrorRangeStart */
	export const serverErrorStart: integer = jsonrpcReservedErrorRangeStart;

	/**
	 * Error code indicating that a server received a notification or
	 * request before the server has received the `initialize` request.
	 */
	export const ServerNotInitialized: integer = -32002;
	export const UnknownErrorCode: integer = -32001;

	/**
	 * This is the start range of JSON RPC reserved error codes.
	 * It doesn't denote a real error code.
	 * 
	 * @since 3.16.0
	 */
	export const jsonrpcReservedErrorRangeEnd = -32000;
	/** @deprecated use jsonrpcReservedErrorRangeEnd */
	export const serverErrorEnd: integer = jsonrpcReservedErrorRangeEnd;

	/**
	 * This is the start range of LSP reserved error codes.
	 * It doesn't denote a real error code.
	 *
	 * @since 3.16.0

	export const lspReservedErrorRangeStart: integer = -32899;

	 */
	export const ContentModified: integer = -32801;

	/**

	 * the cancel.
	 */
	export const RequestCancelled: integer = -32800;

	/**

	 * It doesn't denote a real error code.
	 *
	 * @since 3.16.0
	 */
	export const lspReservedErrorRangeEnd: integer = -32800;
}
```
#### <a href="#notificationMessage" name="notificationMessage" class="anchor"> Notification Message </a>

A notification message. A processed notification message must not send a response back. They work like events.

```typescript
interface NotificationMessage extends Message {
	/**
	 * The method to be invoked.
	 */
	method: string;

	/**
	 * The notification's params.
	 */
	params?: array | object;
}
```

#### <a href="#dollarRequests" name="dollarRequests" class="anchor"> $ Notifications and Requests </a>

Notification and requests whose methods start with '\$/' are messages which are protocol implementation dependent and might not be implementable in all clients or servers. For example if the server implementation uses a single threaded synchronous programming language then there is little a server can do to react to a `$/cancelRequest` notification. If a server or client receives notifications starting with '\$/' it is free to ignore the notification. If a server or client receives a requests starting with '\$/' it must error the request with error code `MethodNotFound` (e.g. `-32601`).

#### <a href="#cancelRequest" name="cancelRequest" class="anchor"> Cancellation Support (:arrow_right: :arrow_left:)</a>

The base protocol offers support for request cancellation. To cancel a request, a notification message with the following properties is sent:

_Notification_:
* method: '$/cancelRequest'
* params: `CancelParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface CancelParams {
	/**
	 * The request id to cancel.
	 */
	id: integer | string;
}
```

A request that got canceled still needs to return from the server and send a response back. It can not be left open / hanging. This is in line with the JSON RPC protocol that requires that every request sends a response back. In addition it allows for returning partial results on cancel. If the request returns an error response on cancellation it is advised to set the error code to `ErrorCodes.RequestCancelled`.

#### <a href="#progress" name="progress" class="anchor"> Progress Support (:arrow_right: :arrow_left:)</a>

> *Since version 3.15.0*

The base protocol offers also support to report progress in a generic fashion. This mechanism can be used to report any kind of progress including work done progress (usually used to report progress in the user interface using a progress bar) and partial result progress to support streaming of results.

A progress notification has the following properties:

_Notification_:
* method: '$/progress'
* params: `ProgressParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
type ProgressToken = integer | string;

interface ProgressParams<T> {
	/**
	 * The progress token provided by the client or server.
	 */
	token: ProgressToken;

	/**
	 * The progress data.
	 */
	value: T;
}
```

Progress is reported against a token. The token is different than the request ID which allows to report progress out of band and also for notification.

### Basic JSON Structures

#### <a href="#uri" name="uri" class="anchor"> URI </a>

URI's are transferred as strings. The URI's format is defined in [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986)

```
  foo://example.com:8042/over/there?name=ferret#nose
  \_/   \______________/\_________/ \_________/ \__/
   |           |            |            |        |
scheme     authority       path        query   fragment
   |   _____________________|__
  / \ /                        \
  urn:example:animal:ferret:nose
```

We also maintain a node module to parse a string into `scheme`, `authority`, `path`, `query`, and `fragment` URI components. The GitHub repository is [https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-uri](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-uri) the npm module is [https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-uri](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-uri).

Many of the interfaces contain fields that correspond to the URI of a document. For clarity, the type of such a field is declared as a `DocumentUri`. Over the wire, it will still be transferred as a string, but this guarantees that the contents of that string can be parsed as a valid URI.

```typescript
type DocumentUri = string;
```

There is also a tagging interface for normal non document URIs. It maps to a `string` as well.

```typescript
type URI = string;
```

#### <a href="#staticRegistrationOptions" name="staticRegistrationOptions" class="anchor"> StaticRegistrationOptions </a>

Static registration options can be used to register a feature in the initialize result with a given server control ID to be able to un-register the feature later on.

```typescript
/**
 * Static registration options to be returned in the initialize request.
 */
export interface StaticRegistrationOptions {
	/**
	 * The id used to register the request. The id can be used to deregister
	 * the request again. See also Registration#id.
	 */
	id?: string;
}
```

#### <a href="#workDoneProgress" name="workDoneProgress" class="anchor"> Work Done Progress </a>

> *Since version 3.15.0*

Work done progress is reported using the generic [`$/progress`](#progress) notification. The value payload of a work done progress notification can be of three different forms.

##### <a href="#workDoneProgressBegin" name="workDoneProgressBegin" class="anchor"> Work Done Progress Begin </a>

To start progress reporting a `$/progress` notification with the following payload must be sent:

```typescript
export interface WorkDoneProgressBegin {

	kind: 'begin';

	/**
	 * Mandatory title of the progress operation. Used to briefly inform about
	 * the kind of operation being performed.
	 *
	 * Examples: "Indexing" or "Linking dependencies".
	 */
	title: string;

	/**
	 * Controls if a cancel button should show to allow the user to cancel the
	 * long running operation. Clients that don't support cancellation are
	 * allowed to ignore the setting.
	 */
	cancellable?: boolean;

	/**
	 * Optional, more detailed associated progress message. Contains
	 * complementary information to the `title`.
	 *
	 * Examples: "3/25 files", "project/src/module2", "node_modules/some_dep".
	 * If unset, the previous progress message (if any) is still valid.
	 */
	message?: string;

	/**
	 * Optional progress percentage to display (value 100 is considered 100%).
	 * If not provided infinite progress is assumed and clients are allowed
	 * to ignore the `percentage` value in subsequent in report notifications.
	 *
	 * The value should be steadily rising. Clients are free to ignore values
	 * that are not following this rule. The value range is [0, 100]
	 */
	percentage?: uinteger;
}
```

##### <a href="#workDoneProgressReport" name="workDoneProgressReport" class="anchor"> Work Done Progress Report </a>

Reporting progress is done using the following payload:

```typescript
export interface WorkDoneProgressReport {

	kind: 'report';

	/**
	 * Controls enablement state of a cancel button. This property is only valid
	 * if a cancel button got requested in the `WorkDoneProgressBegin` payload.
	 *
	 * Clients that don't support cancellation or don't support control the
	 * button's enablement state are allowed to ignore the setting.
	 */
	cancellable?: boolean;

	/**
	 * Optional, more detailed associated progress message. Contains
	 * complementary information to the `title`.
	 *
	 * Examples: "3/25 files", "project/src/module2", "node_modules/some_dep".
	 * If unset, the previous progress message (if any) is still valid.
	 */
	message?: string;

	/**
	 * Optional progress percentage to display (value 100 is considered 100%).
	 * If not provided infinite progress is assumed and clients are allowed
	 * to ignore the `percentage` value in subsequent in report notifications.
	 *
	 * The value should be steadily rising. Clients are free to ignore values
	 * that are not following this rule. The value range is [0, 100]
	 */
	percentage?: uinteger;
}
```

##### <a href="#workDoneProgressEnd" name="workDoneProgressEnd" class="anchor"> Work Done Progress End </a>

Signaling the end of a progress reporting is done using the following payload:

```typescript
export interface WorkDoneProgressEnd {

	kind: 'end';

	/**
	 * Optional, a final message indicating to for example indicate the outcome
	 * of the operation.
	 */
	message?: string;
}
```

##### <a href="#initiatingWorkDoneProgress" name="initiatingWorkDoneProgress" class="anchor"> Initiating Work Done Progress </a>

Work Done progress can be initiated in two different ways:

1. by the sender of a request (mostly clients) using the predefined `workDoneToken` property in the requests parameter literal. The document will refer to this kind of progress as client initiated progress.
1. by a server using the request `window/workDoneProgress/create`. The document will refer to this kind of progress as server initiated progress.

###### <a href="#clientInitiatedProgress" name="clientInitiatedProgress" class="anchor">Client Initiated Progress </a>

Consider a client sending a `textDocument/reference` request to a server and the client accepts work done progress reporting on that request. To signal this to the server the client would add a `workDoneToken` property to the reference request parameters. Something like this:

```json
{
	"textDocument": {
		"uri": "file:///folder/file.ts"
	},
	"position": {
		"line": 9,
		"character": 5
	},
	"context": {
		"includeDeclaration": true
	},
	// The token used to report work done progress.
	"workDoneToken": "1d546990-40a3-4b77-b134-46622995f6ae"
}
```

The corresponding type definition for the parameter property looks like this:

```typescript
export interface WorkDoneProgressParams {
	/**
	 * An optional token that a server can use to report work done progress.
	 */
	workDoneToken?: ProgressToken;
}
```

A server uses the `workDoneToken` to report progress for the specific `textDocument/reference`. For the above request the `$/progress` notification params look like this:

```json
{
	"token": "1d546990-40a3-4b77-b134-46622995f6ae",
	"value": {
		"kind": "begin",
		"title": "Finding references for A#foo",
		"cancellable": false,
		"message": "Processing file X.ts",
		"percentage": 0
	}
}
```

The token received via the `workDoneToken` property in a request's param literal is only valid as long as the request has not send a response back.

There is no specific client capability signaling whether a client will send a progress token per request. The reason for this is that this is in many clients not a static aspect and might even change for every request instance for the same request type. So the capability is signal on every request instance by the presence of a `workDoneToken` property.

To avoid that clients set up a progress monitor user interface before sending a request but the server doesn't actually report any progress a server needs to signal general work done progress reporting support in the corresponding server capability. For the above find references example a server would signal such a support by setting the `referencesProvider` property in the server capabilities as follows:

```json
{
	"referencesProvider": {
		"workDoneProgress": true
	}
}
```

The corresponding type definition for the server capability looks like this:

```typescript
export interface WorkDoneProgressOptions {
	workDoneProgress?: boolean;
}
```
###### <a href="#serverInitiatedProgress" name="serverInitiatedProgress" class="anchor">Server Initiated Progress </a>

Servers can also initiate progress reporting using the `window/workDoneProgress/create` request. This is useful if the server needs to report progress outside of a request (for example the server needs to re-index a database). The returned token can then be used to report progress using the same notifications used as for client initiated progress. A token obtained using the create request should only be used once (e.g. only one begin, many report and one end notification should be sent to it).

To keep the protocol backwards compatible servers are only allowed to use `window/workDoneProgress/create` request if the client signals corresponding support using the client capability `window.workDoneProgress` which is defined as follows:

```typescript
	/**
	 * Window specific client capabilities.
	 */
	window?: {
		/**
		 * Whether client supports server initiated progress using the
		 * `window/workDoneProgress/create` request.
		 */
		workDoneProgress?: boolean;
	};
```

#### <a href="#partialResults" name="partialResults" class="anchor"> Partial Result Progress </a>

> *Since version 3.15.0*

Partial results are also reported using the generic [`$/progress`](#progress) notification. The value payload of a partial result progress notification is in most cases the same as the final result. For example the `workspace/symbol` request has `SymbolInformation[]` as the result type. Partial result is therefore also of type `SymbolInformation[]`. Whether a client accepts partial result notifications for a request is signaled by adding a `partialResultToken` to the request parameter. For example, a `textDocument/reference` request that supports both work done and partial result progress might look like this:

```json
{
	"textDocument": {
		"uri": "file:///folder/file.ts"
	},
	"position": {
		"line": 9,
		"character": 5
	},
	"context": {
		"includeDeclaration": true
	},
	// The token used to report work done progress.
	"workDoneToken": "1d546990-40a3-4b77-b134-46622995f6ae",
	// The token used to report partial result progress.
	"partialResultToken": "5f6f349e-4f81-4a3b-afff-ee04bff96804"
}
```

The `partialResultToken` is then used to report partial results for the find references request.

If a server reports partial result via a corresponding `$/progress`, the whole result must be reported using n `$/progress` notifications. The final response has to be empty in terms of result values. This avoids confusion about how the final result should be interpreted, e.g. as another partial result or as a replacing result.

If the response errors the provided partial results should be treated as follows:

- the `code` equals to `RequestCancelled`: the client is free to use the provided results but should make clear that the request got canceled and may be incomplete.
- in all other cases the provided partial results shouldn't be used.

#### <a href="#partialResultParams" name="partialResultParams" class="anchor"> PartialResultParams </a>

A parameter literal used to pass a partial result token.

```typescript
export interface PartialResultParams {
	/**
	 * An optional token that a server can use to report partial results (e.g.
	 * streaming) to the client.
	 */
	partialResultToken?: ProgressToken;
}
```

#### <a href="#traceValue" name="traceValue" class="anchor"> TraceValue </a>

A `TraceValue` represents the level of verbosity with which the server systematically reports its execution trace using [$/logTrace](#logTrace) notifications.
The initial trace value is set by the client at initialization and can be modified later using the [$/setTrace](#setTrace) notification.

```typescript
export type TraceValue = 'off' | 'message' | 'verbose';
```

### Actual Protocol

This section documents the actual language server protocol. It uses the following format:

* a header describing the request
* an optional _Client capability_ section describing the client capability of the request. This includes the client capabilities property path and JSON structure.
* an optional _Server Capability_ section describing the server capability of the request. This includes the server capabilities property path and JSON structure. Clients should ignore server capabilities they don't understand (e.g. the initialize request shouldn't fail in this case).
* an optional _Registration Options_ section describing the registration option if the request or notification supports dynamic capability registration. See the [register](#client_registerCapability) and [unregister](#client_unregisterCapability) request for how this works in detail.
* a _Request_ section describing the format of the request sent. The method is a string identifying the request the params are documented using a TypeScript interface. It is also documented whether the request supports work done progress and partial result progress.
* a _Response_ section describing the format of the response. The result item describes the returned data in case of a success. The optional partial result item describes the returned data of a partial result notification. The error.data describes the returned data in case of an error. Please remember that in case of a failure the response already contains an error.code and an error.message field. These fields are only specified if the protocol forces the use of certain error codes or messages. In cases where the server can decide on these values freely they aren't listed here.

#### Server lifetime

The current protocol specification defines that the lifetime of a server is managed by the client (e.g. a tool like VS Code or Emacs). It is up to the client to decide when to start (process-wise) and when to shutdown a server.

#### <a href="#initialize" name="initialize" class="anchor">Initialize Request (:leftwards_arrow_with_hook:)</a>

The initialize request is sent as the first request from the client to the server. If the server receives a request or notification before the `initialize` request it should act as follows:

* For a request the response should be an error with `code: -32002`. The message can be picked by the server.
* Notifications should be dropped, except for the exit notification. This will allow the exit of a server without an initialize request.

Until the server has responded to the `initialize` request with an `InitializeResult`, the client must not send any additional requests or notifications to the server. In addition the server is not allowed to send any requests or notifications to the client until it has responded with an `InitializeResult`, with the exception that during the `initialize` request the server is allowed to send the notifications `window/showMessage`, `window/logMessage` and `telemetry/event` as well as the `window/showMessageRequest` request to the client. In case the client sets up a progress token in the initialize params (e.g. property `workDoneToken`) the server is also allowed to use that token (and only that token) using the `$/progress` notification sent from the server to the client.

The `initialize` request may only be sent once.

_Request_:
* method: 'initialize'
* params: `InitializeParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface InitializeParams extends WorkDoneProgressParams {
	/**
	 * The process Id of the parent process that started the server. Is null if
	 * the process has not been started by another process. If the parent
	 * process is not alive then the server should exit (see exit notification)
	 * its process.
	 */
	processId: integer | null;

	/**
	 * Information about the client
	 *
	 * @since 3.15.0
	 */
	clientInfo?: {
		/**
		 * The name of the client as defined by the client.
		 */
		name: string;

		/**
		 * The client's version as defined by the client.
		 */
		version?: string;
	};

	/**
	 * The locale the client is currently showing the user interface
	 * in. This must not necessarily be the locale of the operating
	 * system.
	 *
	 * Uses IETF language tags as the value's syntax
	 * (See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag)

`ClientCapabilities` define capabilities for dynamic registration and other features the client supports. The `experimental` can be used to pass experimental capabilities under development. For future compatibility a `ClientCapabilities` object literal can have more properties set than currently defined. Servers receiving a `ClientCapabilities` object literal with unknown properties should ignore these properties. A missing property should be interpreted as an absence of the capability. If a missing property normally defines sub properties, all missing sub properties should be interpreted as an absence of the corresponding capability.

Client capabilities got introduced with version 3.0 of the protocol. They therefore only describe capabilities that got introduced in 3.x or later. Capabilities that existed in the 2.x version of the protocol are still mandatory for clients.

Many of the mentioned client and server capabilities below are documented in detail in their specific [specs](#specs).

#### <a href="#initialized" name="initialized" class="anchor">Initialized Notification (:arrow_right:)</a>

The initialized notification is sent from the client to the server after the client received the result of the `initialize` request but before the client is sending any other request or notification to the server. The server can use the `initialized` notification for example to dynamically register capabilities. The `initialized` notification may only be sent once.

_Notification_:
* method: 'initialized'
* params: `InitializedParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface InitializedParams {
}
```

#### <a href="#shutdown" name="shutdown" class="anchor">Shutdown Request (:leftwards_arrow_with_hook:)</a>

The shutdown request is sent from the client to the server. It asks the server to shut down, but to not exit (otherwise the response might not be delivered correctly to the client). There is a separate exit notification that asks the server to exit. Clients must not send any notifications other than `exit` or requests to a server to which they have sent a shutdown request. If a server receives requests after a shutdown request those requests should error with `InvalidRequest`.

_Request_:
* method: 'shutdown'
* params: void

_Response_:
* result: null
* error: code and message set in case an exception happens during shutdown request.

#### <a href="#exit" name="exit" class="anchor">Exit Notification (:arrow_right:)</a>

A notification to ask the server to exit its process.
The server should exit with `success` code 0 if the shutdown request has been received before; otherwise with `error` code 1.

_Notification_:
* method: 'exit'
* params: void

#### <a href="#logTrace" name="logTrace" class="anchor">LogTrace Notification (:arrow_left:)</a>

A notification to log the trace of the server's execution.
The amount and content of these notifications depends on the current `trace` configuration.
If `trace` is `'off'`, the server should not send any `logTrace` notification.
If `trace` is `'message'`, the server should not add the `'verbose'` field in the `LogTraceParams`.

`$/logTrace` should be used for systematic trace reporting. For single debugging messages, the server should send [`window/logMessage`](#window_logMessage) notifications.


_Notification_:
* method: '$/logTrace'
* params: `LogTraceParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface LogTraceParams {
	/**
	 * The message to be logged.
	 */
	message: string;
	/**
	 * Additional information that can be computed if the `trace` configuration
	 * is set to `'verbose'`
	 */
	verbose?: string;
}
```

#### <a href="#setTrace" name="setTrace" class="anchor">SetTrace Notification (:arrow_right:)</a>

A notification that should be used by the client to modify the trace setting of the server.

_Notification_:
* method: '$/setTrace'
* params: `SetTraceParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface SetTraceParams {
	/**
	 * The new value that should be assigned to the trace setting.
	 */
	value: TraceValue;
}
```

#### <a href="#window_showMessage" name="window_showMessage" class="anchor">ShowMessage Notification (:arrow_left:)</a>

The show message notification is sent from a server to a client to ask the client to display a particular message in the user interface.

_Notification_:
* method: 'window/showMessage'
* params: `ShowMessageParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface ShowMessageParams {
	/**
	 * The message type. See {@link MessageType}.
	 */
	type: MessageType;

	/**
	 * The actual message.
	 */
	message: string;
}
```

Where the type is defined as follows:

```typescript
export namespace MessageType {
	/**
	 * An error message.
	 */

	 */
	export const Warning = 2;
	/**
	 * An information message.
	 */
	export const Info = 3;
	/**
	 * A log message.
	 */
	export const Log = 4;
}

export type MessageType = 1 | 2 | 3 | 4;
```

#### <a href="#window_showMessageRequest" name="window_showMessageRequest" class="anchor">ShowMessage Request (:arrow_right_hook:)</a>

The show message request is sent from a server to a client to ask the client to display a particular message in the user interface. In addition to the show message notification the request allows to pass actions and to wait for an answer from the client.

_Client Capability_:
* property path (optional): `window.showMessage`
* property type: `ShowMessageRequestClientCapabilities` defined as follows:

```typescript

		 * are preserved and sent back to the server in the
		 * request's response.
		 */
		additionalPropertiesSupport?: boolean;
	};
}
```

_Request_:
* method: 'window/showMessageRequest'
* params: `ShowMessageRequestParams` defined as follows:

_Response_:
* result: the selected `MessageActionItem` \| `null` if none got selected.
* error: code and message set in case an exception happens during showing a message.

```typescript

	 */
	external?: boolean;

	/**
	 * An optional property to indicate whether the editor
	 * showing the document should take focus or not.
	 * Clients might ignore this property if an external
	 * program is started.
	 */
	takeFocus?: boolean;

	/**

	 */
	success: boolean;
}
```
* error: code and message set in case an exception happens during showing a document.

#### <a href="#window_logMessage" name="window_logMessage" class="anchor">LogMessage Notification (:arrow_left:)</a>

The log message notification is sent from the server to the client to ask the client to log a particular message.

_Notification_:
* method: 'window/logMessage'
* params: `LogMessageParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface LogMessageParams {
	/**
	 * The message type. See {@link MessageType}
	 */
	type: MessageType;

	/**
	 * The actual message
	 */
	message: string;
}
```

#### <a href="#window_workDoneProgress_create" name="window_workDoneProgress_create" class="anchor"> Creating Work Done Progress (:arrow_right_hook:)</a>

The `window/workDoneProgress/create` request is sent from the server to the client to ask the client to create a work done progress.

_Request_:

* method: 'window/workDoneProgress/create'
* params: `WorkDoneProgressCreateParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
export interface WorkDoneProgressCreateParams {
	/**
	 * The token to be used to report progress.
	 */
	token: ProgressToken;
}
```

_Response_:

* result: void
* error: code and message set in case an exception happens during the 'window/workDoneProgress/create' request. In case an error occurs a server must not send any progress notification using the token provided in the `WorkDoneProgressCreateParams`.

#### <a href="#window_workDoneProgress_cancel" name="window_workDoneProgress_cancel" class="anchor"> Canceling a Work Done Progress (:arrow_right:)</a>

The `window/workDoneProgress/cancel` notification is sent from the client to the server to cancel a progress initiated on the server side using the `window/workDoneProgress/create`. The progress need not be marked as `cancellable` to be cancelled and a client may cancel a progress for any number of reasons: in case of error, reloading a workspace etc.

_Notification_:

* method: 'window/workDoneProgress/cancel'
* params: `WorkDoneProgressCancelParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
export interface WorkDoneProgressCancelParams {
	/**
	 * The token to be used to report progress.
	 */
	token: ProgressToken;
}
```

#### <a href="#telemetry_event" name="telemetry_event" class="anchor">Telemetry Notification (:arrow_left:)</a>

The telemetry notification is sent from the server to the client to ask the client to log a telemetry event. The protocol doesn't specify the payload since no interpretation of the data happens in the protocol. Most clients even don't handle the event directly but forward them to the extensions owing the corresponding server issuing the event.

_Notification_:
* method: 'telemetry/event'
* params: 'object' \| 'number' \| 'boolean' \| 'string';

#### <a href="#client_registerCapability" name="client_registerCapability" class="anchor">Register Capability (:arrow_right_hook:)</a>

The `client/registerCapability` request is sent from the server to the client to register for a new capability on the client side. Not all clients need to support dynamic capability registration. A client opts in via the `dynamicRegistration` property on the specific client capabilities. A client can even provide dynamic registration for capability A but not for capability B (see `TextDocumentClientCapabilities` as an example).

Server must not register the same capability both statically through the initialize result and dynamically for the same document selector. If a server wants to support both static and dynamic registration it needs to check the client capability in the initialize request and only register the capability statically if the client doesn't support dynamic registration for that capability.

_Request_:
* method: 'client/registerCapability'
* params: `RegistrationParams`

Where `RegistrationParams` are defined as follows:

```typescript
/**
 * General parameters to register for a capability.
 */
export interface Registration {
	/**
	 * The id used to register the request. The id can be used to deregister
	 * the request again.
	 */
	id: string;

	/**
	 * The method / capability to register for.
	 */
	method: string;

	/**
	 * Options necessary for the registration.
	 */
	registerOptions?: any;
}

export interface RegistrationParams {
	registrations: Registration[];
}
```

Since most of the registration options require to specify a document selector there is a base interface that can be used. See `TextDocumentRegistrationOptions`.

An example JSON RPC message to register dynamically for the `textDocument/willSaveWaitUntil` feature on the client side is as follows (only details shown):

```json
{
	"method": "client/registerCapability",
	"params": {
		"registrations": [
			{
				"id": "79eee87c-c409-4664-8102-e03263673f6f",
				"method": "textDocument/willSaveWaitUntil",
				"registerOptions": {
					"documentSelector": [
						{ "language": "javascript" }
					]
				}
			}
		]
	}
}
```

This message is sent from the server to the client and after the client has successfully executed the request further `textDocument/willSaveWaitUntil` requests for JavaScript text documents are sent from the client to the server.

_Response_:
* result: void.
* error: code and message set in case an exception happens during the request.

#### <a href="#client_unregisterCapability" name="client_unregisterCapability" class="anchor">Unregister Capability (:arrow_right_hook:)</a>

The `client/unregisterCapability` request is sent from the server to the client to unregister a previously registered capability.

_Request_:
* method: 'client/unregisterCapability'
* params: `UnregistrationParams`

Where `UnregistrationParams` are defined as follows:

```typescript
/**
 * General parameters to unregister a capability.
 */
export interface Unregistration {
	/**
	 * The id used to unregister the request or notification. Usually an id
	 * provided during the register request.
	 */
	id: string;

	/**
	 * The method / capability to unregister for.
	 */
	method: string;
}

export interface UnregistrationParams {
	// This should correctly be named `unregistrations`. However changing this
	// is a breaking change and needs to wait until we deliver a 4.x version
	// of the specification.
	unregisterations: Unregistration[];
}
```

An example JSON RPC message to unregister the above registered `textDocument/willSaveWaitUntil` feature looks like this:

```json
{
	"method": "client/unregisterCapability",
	"params": {
		"unregisterations": [
			{
				"id": "79eee87c-c409-4664-8102-e03263673f6f",
				"method": "textDocument/willSaveWaitUntil"
			}
		]
	}
}
```
_Response_:
* result: void.
* error: code and message set in case an exception happens during the request.

### <a href="#implementationConsiderations" name="implementationConsiderations" class="anchor">Implementation Considerations</a>

Language servers usually run in a separate process and client communicate with them in an asynchronous fashion. Additionally clients usually allow users to interact with the source code even if request results are pending. We recommend the following implementation pattern to avoid that clients apply outdated response results:

- if a client sends a request to the server and the client state changes in a way that it invalidates the response it should do the following:
  - cancel the server request and ignore the result if the result is not useful for the client anymore. If necessary the client should resend the request.
  - keep the request running if the client can still make use of the result by for example transforming it to a new result by applying the state change to the result.
- servers should therefore not decide by themselves to cancel requests simply due to that fact that a state change notification is detected in the queue. As said the result could still be useful for the client.
- if a server detects an internal state change (for example a project context changed) that invalidates the result of a request in execution the server can error these requests with `ContentModified`. If clients receive a `ContentModified` error, it generally should not show it in the UI for the end-user. Clients can resend the request if they know how to do so. It should be noted that for all position based requests it might be especially hard for clients to re-craft a request.
- if a client notices that a server exits unexpectedly, it should try to restart the server. However clients should be careful not to restart a crashing server endlessly. VS Code, for example, doesn't restart a server which has crashed 5 times in the last 180 seconds.

Servers usually support different communication channels (e.g. stdio, pipes, ...). To easy the usage of servers in different clients it is highly recommended that a server implementation supports the following command line arguments to pick the communication channel:

- **stdio**: uses stdio as the communication channel.
- **pipe**: use pipes (Windows) or socket files (Linux, Mac) as the communication channel. The pipe / socket file name is passed as the next arg or with `--pipe=`.
- **socket**: uses a socket as the communication channel. The port is passed as next arg or with `--port=`.
- **node-ipc**: use node IPC communication between the client and the server. This is only support if both client and server run under node.
