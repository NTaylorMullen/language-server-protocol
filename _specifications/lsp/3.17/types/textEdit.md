#### <a href="#textEdit" name="textEdit" class="anchor"> TextEdit & AnnotatedTextEdit </a>

> New in version 3.16: Support for `AnnotatedTextEdit`.

A textual edit applicable to a text document.

```typescript
interface TextEdit {
	/**
	 * The range of the text document to be manipulated. To insert
	 * text into a document create a range where start === end.
	 */
	range: Range;

	/**
	 * The string to be inserted. For delete operations use an
	 * empty string.
	 */
	newText: string;
}
```

Since 3.16.0 there is also the concept of an annotated text edit which supports to add an annotation to a text edit. The annotation can add information describing the change to the text edit.

```typescript
/**
 * Additional information that describes document changes.
 *
 * @since 3.16.0
 */
export interface ChangeAnnotation {
	/**
	 * A human-readable string describing the actual change. The string
	 * is rendered prominent in the user interface.
	 */
	label: string;

	/**
	 * A flag which indicates that user confirmation is needed
	 * before applying the change.
	 */
	needsConfirmation?: boolean;

	/**
	 * A human-readable string which is rendered less prominent in
	 * the user interface.
	 */
	description?: string;
}
```

Usually clients provide options to group the changes along the annotations they are associated with. To support this in the protocol an edit or resource operation refers to a change annotation using an identifier and not the change annotation literal directly. This allows servers to use the identical annotation across multiple edits or resource operations which then allows clients to group the operations under that change annotation. The actual change annotations together with their identifers are managed by the workspace edit via the new property `changeAnnotations`.

```typescript

/**
 * An identifier referring to a change annotation managed by a workspace
 * edit.
 *
 * @since 3.16.0.
 */
export type ChangeAnnotationIdentifier = string;


/**
 * A special text edit with an additional change annotation.
 *
 * @since 3.16.0.
 */
export interface AnnotatedTextEdit extends TextEdit {
	/**
	 * The actual annotation identifier.
	 */
	annotationId: ChangeAnnotationIdentifier;
}
```

#### <a href="#textEditArray" name="textEditArray" class="anchor"> TextEdit[] </a>

Complex text manipulations are described with an array of `TextEdit`'s or `AnnotatedTextEdit`'s, representing a single change to the document.

All text edits ranges refer to positions in the document the are computed on. They therefore move a document from state S1 to S2 without describing any intermediate state. Text edits ranges must never overlap, that means no part of the original document must be manipulated by more than one edit. However, it is possible that multiple edits have the same start position: multiple inserts, or any number of inserts followed by a single remove or replace edit. If multiple inserts have the same position, the order in the array defines the order in which the inserted strings appear in the resulting text.


#### <a href="#textDocumentEdit" name="textDocumentEdit" class="anchor"> TextDocumentEdit </a>

> New in version 3.16: support for `AnnotatedTextEdit`. The support is guarded by the client capability `workspace.workspaceEdit.changeAnnotationSupport`. If a client doesn't signal the capability, servers shouldn't send `AnnotatedTextEdit` literals back to the client.

Describes textual changes on a single text document. The text document is referred to as a `OptionalVersionedTextDocumentIdentifier` to allow clients to check the text document version before an edit is applied. A `TextDocumentEdit` describes all changes on a version Si and after they are applied move the document to version Si+1. So the creator of a `TextDocumentEdit` doesn't need to sort the array of edits or do any kind of ordering. However the edits must be non overlapping.

```typescript
export interface TextDocumentEdit {
	/**
	 * The text document to change.
	 */
	textDocument: OptionalVersionedTextDocumentIdentifier;

	/**
	 * The edits to be applied.
	 *
	 * @since 3.16.0 - support for AnnotatedTextEdit. This is guarded by the
	 * client capability `workspace.workspaceEdit.changeAnnotationSupport`
	 */
	edits: (TextEdit | AnnotatedTextEdit)[];
}
```
