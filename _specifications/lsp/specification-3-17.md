# Language Server Protocol Specification - 3.17

This document describes the upcoming 3.17.x version of the language server protocol based on the corresponding [base protocol](/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-base). An implementation for node of the 3.17.x version of the protocol can be found [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-languageserver-node).

**Note:** edits to this specification can be made via a pull request against this markdown [document](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol/blob/gh-pages/_specifications/lsp/specification-3-17.md).

## <a href="#whatIsNew" name="whatIsNew" class="anchor"> What's new in 3.17 </a>

All new 3.17 features are tagged with a corresponding since version 3.17 text or in JSDoc using `@since 3.17.0` annotation. Major new feature are:

- None so far.

A detailed list of the changes can be found in the [change log](#version_3_17_0)

The version of the specification is used to group features into a new specification release and to refer to their first appearance. Features in the spec are kept compatible using so called capability flags which are exchanged between the client and the server during initialization.

## Language Server Protocol

The language server protocol defines a set of JSON-RPC request, response and notification messages which are exchanged using the [base protocol](/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-base#baseProtocol). This section starts describing the basic JSON structures used in the protocol. The document uses TypeScript interfaces to describe these. Based on the basic JSON structures, the actual requests with their responses and the notifications are described.

In general, the language server protocol supports JSON-RPC messages, however the base protocol defined here uses a convention such that the parameters passed to request/notification messages should be of `object` type (if passed at all). However, this does not disallow using `Array` parameter types in custom messages.

The protocol currently assumes that one server serves one tool. There is currently no support in the protocol to share one server between different tools. Such a sharing would require additional protocol e.g. to lock a document to support concurrent editing.

### Basic JSON Structures

Many basic structures referenced in this document are defined in the [base protocol](/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-base#baseProtocol).

#### <a href="#regExp" name="regExp" class="anchor"> Regular Expressions </a>

Regular expression are a powerful tool and there are actual use cases for them in the language server protocol. However the downside with them is that almost every programming language has its own set of regular expression features so the specification can not simply refer to them as a regular expression. So the LSP uses a two step approach to support regular expressions:

* the client will announce which regular expression engine it will use. This will allow server that are written for a very specific client make full use of the regular expression capabilities of the client
* the specification will define a set of regular expression features that should be supported by a client. Instead of writing a new specification LSP will refer to the [ECMAScript Regular Expression specification](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-regexp-regular-expression-objects) and remove features from it that are not necessary in the context of LSP or hard to implement for other clients.

_Client Capability_:

The following client capability is used to announce a client's regular expression engine

* property path (optional): `general.regularExpressions`
* property type: `RegularExpressionsClientCapabilities` defined as follows:

```typescript
/**
 * Client capabilities specific to regular expressions.
 */
export interface RegularExpressionsClientCapabilities {
	/**
	 * The engine's name.
	 */
	engine: string;

	/**
	 * The engine's version.
	 */
	version?: string;
}
```

The following table lists the well known engine values. Please note that the table should be driven by the community which integrates LSP into existing clients. It is not the goal of the spec to list all available regular expression engines.

Engine | Version | Documentation
------- | ------- | -------------
ECMAScript | `ES2020` | [ECMAScript 2020](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-regexp-regular-expression-objects) & [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions)

_Regular Expression Subset_:

The following features from the [ECMAScript 2020](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-regexp-regular-expression-objects) regular expression specification are NOT mandatory for a client:

- *Assertions*: Lookahead assertion, Negative lookahead assertion, lookbehind assertion, negative lookbehind assertion.
- *Character classes*: matching control characters using caret notation (e.g. `\cX`) and matching UTF-16 code units (e.g. `\uhhhh`).
- *Group and ranges*: named capturing groups.
- *Unicode property escapes*: none of the features needs to be supported.

The only regular expression flag that a client needs to support is 'i' to specify a case insensitive search.

#### <a href="#textDocuments" name="textDocuments" class="anchor"> Text Documents </a>

The current protocol is tailored for textual documents whose content can be represented as a string. There is currently no support for binary documents. A position inside a document (see Position definition below) is expressed as a zero-based line and character offset. The offsets are based on a UTF-16 string representation. So a string of the form `a𐐀b` the character offset of the character `a` is 0, the character offset of `𐐀` is 1 and the character offset of b is 3 since `𐐀` is represented using two code units in UTF-16. To ensure that both client and server split the string into the same line representation the protocol specifies the following end-of-line sequences: '\n', '\r\n' and '\r'.

Positions are line end character agnostic. So you can not specify a position that denotes `\r|\n` or `\n|` where `|` represents the character offset.

```typescript
export const EOL: string[] = ['\n', '\r\n', '\r'];
```

#### <a href="#position" name="position" class="anchor"> Position </a>

Position in a text document expressed as zero-based line and zero-based character offset. A position is between two characters like an 'insert' cursor in a editor. Special values like for example `-1` to denote the end of a line are not supported.

```typescript
interface Position {
	/**
	 * Line position in a document (zero-based).
	 */
	line: uinteger;

	/**
	 * Character offset on a line in a document (zero-based). Assuming that
	 * the line is represented as a string, the `character` value represents
	 * the gap between the `character` and `character + 1`.
	 *
	 * If the character value is greater than the line length it defaults back
	 * to the line length.
	 */
	character: uinteger;
}
```
#### <a href="#range" name="range" class="anchor"> Range </a>

A range in a text document expressed as (zero-based) start and end positions. A range is comparable to a selection in an editor. Therefore the end position is exclusive. If you want to specify a range that contains a line including the line ending character(s) then use an end position denoting the start of the next line. For example:
```typescript
{
    start: { line: 5, character: 23 },
    end : { line: 6, character: 0 }
}
```

```typescript
interface Range {
	/**
	 * The range's start position.
	 */
	start: Position;

	/**
	 * The range's end position.
	 */
	end: Position;
}
```

#### <a href="#location" name="location" class="anchor"> Location </a>

Represents a location inside a resource, such as a line inside a text file.
```typescript
interface Location {
	uri: DocumentUri;
	range: Range;
}
```

#### <a href="#locationLink" name="locationLink" class="anchor"> LocationLink </a>

Represents a link between a source and a target location.

```typescript
interface LocationLink {

	/**
	 * Span of the origin of this link.
	 *
	 * Used as the underlined span for mouse interaction. Defaults to the word
	 * range at the mouse position.
	 */
	originSelectionRange?: Range;

	/**
	 * The target resource identifier of this link.
	 */
	targetUri: DocumentUri;

	/**
	 * The full target range of this link. If the target for example is a symbol
	 * then target range is the range enclosing this symbol not including
	 * leading/trailing whitespace but everything else like comments. This
	 * information is typically used to highlight the range in the editor.
	 */
	targetRange: Range;

	/**
	 * The range that should be selected and revealed when this link is being
	 * followed, e.g the name of a function. Must be contained by the the
	 * `targetRange`. See also `DocumentSymbol#range`
	 */
	targetSelectionRange: Range;
}
```

#### <a href="#diagnostic" name="diagnostic" class="anchor"> Diagnostic </a>

Represents a diagnostic, such as a compiler error or warning. Diagnostic objects are only valid in the scope of a resource.

```typescript
export interface Diagnostic {
	/**
	 * The range at which the message applies.
	 */
	range: Range;

	/**
	 * The diagnostic's severity. Can be omitted. If omitted it is up to the
	 * client to interpret diagnostics as error, warning, info or hint.
	 */
	severity?: DiagnosticSeverity;

	/**
	 * The diagnostic's code, which might appear in the user interface.
	 */
	code?: integer | string;

	/**
	 * An optional property to describe the error code.
	 *
	 * @since 3.16.0
	 */
	codeDescription?: CodeDescription;

	/**
	 * A human-readable string describing the source of this
	 * diagnostic, e.g. 'typescript' or 'super lint'.
	 */
	source?: string;

	/**
	 * The diagnostic's message.
	 */
	message: string;

	/**
	 * Additional metadata about the diagnostic.
	 *
	 * @since 3.15.0
	 */
	tags?: DiagnosticTag[];

	/**
	 * An array of related diagnostic information, e.g. when symbol-names within
	 * a scope collide all definitions can be marked via this property.
	 */
	relatedInformation?: DiagnosticRelatedInformation[];

	/**
	 * A data entry field that is preserved between a
	 * `textDocument/publishDiagnostics` notification and
	 * `textDocument/codeAction` request.
	 *
	 * @since 3.16.0
	 */
	data?: unknown;
}
```

The protocol currently supports the following diagnostic severities and tags:

```typescript
export namespace DiagnosticSeverity {
	/**
	 * Reports an error.
	 */
	export const Error: 1 = 1;
	/**
	 * Reports a warning.
	 */
	export const Warning: 2 = 2;
	/**
	 * Reports an information.
	 */
	export const Information: 3 = 3;
	/**
	 * Reports a hint.
	 */
	export const Hint: 4 = 4;
}

export type DiagnosticSeverity = 1 | 2 | 3 | 4;

/**
 * The diagnostic tags.
 *
 * @since 3.15.0
 */
export namespace DiagnosticTag {
	/**
	 * Unused or unnecessary code.
	 *
	 * Clients are allowed to render diagnostics with this tag faded out
	 * instead of having an error squiggle.
	 */
	export const Unnecessary: 1 = 1;
	/**
	 * Deprecated or obsolete code.
	 *
	 * Clients are allowed to rendered diagnostics with this tag strike through.
	 */
	export const Deprecated: 2 = 2;
}

export type DiagnosticTag = 1 | 2;
```

`DiagnosticRelatedInformation` is defined as follows:

```typescript
/**
 * Represents a related message and source code location for a diagnostic.
 * This should be used to point to code locations that cause or are related to
 * a diagnostics, e.g when duplicating a symbol in a scope.
 */
export interface DiagnosticRelatedInformation {
	/**
	 * The location of this related diagnostic information.
	 */
	location: Location;

	/**
	 * The message of this related diagnostic information.
	 */
	message: string;
}
```

`CodeDescription` is defined as follows:

```typescript
/**
 * Structure to capture a description for an error code.
 *
 * @since 3.16.0
 */
export interface CodeDescription {
	/**
	 * An URI to open with more information about the diagnostic error.
	 */
	href: URI;
}
```

#### <a href="#command" name="command" class="anchor"> Command </a>

Represents a reference to a command. Provides a title which will be used to represent a command in the UI. Commands are identified by a string identifier. The recommended way to handle commands is to implement their execution on the server side if the client and server provides the corresponding capabilities. Alternatively the tool extension code could handle the command. The protocol currently doesn't specify a set of well-known commands.

```typescript
interface Command {
	/**
	 * Title of the command, like `save`.
	 */
	title: string;
	/**
	 * The identifier of the actual command handler.
	 */
	command: string;
	/**
	 * Arguments that the command handler should be
	 * invoked with.
	 */
	arguments?: any[];
}
```

#### <a href="#textEdit" name="textEdit" class="anchor"> TextEdit & AnnotatedTextEdit </a>

> New in version 3.16: Support for `AnnotatedTextEdit`.

A textual edit applicable to a text document.

```typescript
interface TextEdit {
	/**
	 * The range of the text document to be manipulated. To insert
	 * text into a document create a range where start === end.
	 */
	range: Range;

	/**
	 * The string to be inserted. For delete operations use an
	 * empty string.
	 */
	newText: string;
}
```

Since 3.16.0 there is also the concept of an annotated text edit which supports to add an annotation to a text edit. The annotation can add information describing the change to the text edit.

```typescript
/**
 * Additional information that describes document changes.
 *
 * @since 3.16.0
 */
export interface ChangeAnnotation {
	/**
	 * A human-readable string describing the actual change. The string
	 * is rendered prominent in the user interface.
	 */
	label: string;

	/**
	 * A flag which indicates that user confirmation is needed
	 * before applying the change.
	 */
	needsConfirmation?: boolean;

	/**
	 * A human-readable string which is rendered less prominent in
	 * the user interface.
	 */
	description?: string;
}
```

Usually clients provide options to group the changes along the annotations they are associated with. To support this in the protocol an edit or resource operation refers to a change annotation using an identifier and not the change annotation literal directly. This allows servers to use the identical annotation across multiple edits or resource operations which then allows clients to group the operations under that change annotation. The actual change annotations together with their identifers are managed by the workspace edit via the new property `changeAnnotations`.

```typescript

/**
 * An identifier referring to a change annotation managed by a workspace
 * edit.
 *
 * @since 3.16.0.
 */
export type ChangeAnnotationIdentifier = string;


/**
 * A special text edit with an additional change annotation.
 *
 * @since 3.16.0.
 */
export interface AnnotatedTextEdit extends TextEdit {
	/**
	 * The actual annotation identifier.
	 */
	annotationId: ChangeAnnotationIdentifier;
}
```

#### <a href="#textEditArray" name="textEditArray" class="anchor"> TextEdit[] </a>

Complex text manipulations are described with an array of `TextEdit`'s or `AnnotatedTextEdit`'s, representing a single change to the document.

All text edits ranges refer to positions in the document the are computed on. They therefore move a document from state S1 to S2 without describing any intermediate state. Text edits ranges must never overlap, that means no part of the original document must be manipulated by more than one edit. However, it is possible that multiple edits have the same start position: multiple inserts, or any number of inserts followed by a single remove or replace edit. If multiple inserts have the same position, the order in the array defines the order in which the inserted strings appear in the resulting text.

#### <a href="#textDocumentEdit" name="textDocumentEdit" class="anchor"> TextDocumentEdit </a>

> New in version 3.16: support for `AnnotatedTextEdit`. The support is guarded by the client capability `workspace.workspaceEdit.changeAnnotationSupport`. If a client doesn't signal the capability, servers shouldn't send `AnnotatedTextEdit` literals back to the client.

Describes textual changes on a single text document. The text document is referred to as a `OptionalVersionedTextDocumentIdentifier` to allow clients to check the text document version before an edit is applied. A `TextDocumentEdit` describes all changes on a version Si and after they are applied move the document to version Si+1. So the creator of a `TextDocumentEdit` doesn't need to sort the array of edits or do any kind of ordering. However the edits must be non overlapping.

```typescript
export interface TextDocumentEdit {
	/**
	 * The text document to change.
	 */
	textDocument: OptionalVersionedTextDocumentIdentifier;

	/**
	 * The edits to be applied.
	 *
	 * @since 3.16.0 - support for AnnotatedTextEdit. This is guarded by the
	 * client capability `workspace.workspaceEdit.changeAnnotationSupport`
	 */
	edits: (TextEdit | AnnotatedTextEdit)[];
}
```

### <a href="#resourceChanges" name="resourceChanges" class="anchor"> File Resource changes </a>

> New in version 3.13. Since version 3.16 file resource changes can carry an additional property `changeAnnotation` to describe the actual change in more detail. Whether a client has support for change annotations is guarded by the client capability `workspace.workspaceEdit.changeAnnotationSupport`.

File resource changes allow servers to create, rename and delete files and folders via the client. Note that the names talk about files but the operations are supposed to work on files and folders. This is in line with other naming in the Language Server Protocol (see file watchers which can watch files and folders). The corresponding change literals look as follows:

```typescript
/**
 * Options to create a file.
 */
export interface CreateFileOptions {
	/**
	 * Overwrite existing file. Overwrite wins over `ignoreIfExists`
	 */
	overwrite?: boolean;

	/**
	 * Ignore if exists.
	 */
	ignoreIfExists?: boolean;
}

/**
 * Create file operation
 */
export interface CreateFile {
	/**
	 * A create
	 */
	kind: 'create';

	/**
	 * The resource to create.
	 */
	uri: DocumentUri;

	/**
	 * Additional options
	 */
	options?: CreateFileOptions;

	/**
	 * An optional annotation identifer describing the operation.
	 *
	 * @since 3.16.0
	 */
	annotationId?: ChangeAnnotationIdentifier;
}

/**
 * Rename file options
 */
export interface RenameFileOptions {
	/**
	 * Overwrite target if existing. Overwrite wins over `ignoreIfExists`
	 */
	overwrite?: boolean;

	/**
	 * Ignores if target exists.
	 */
	ignoreIfExists?: boolean;
}

/**
 * Rename file operation
 */
export interface RenameFile {
	/**
	 * A rename
	 */
	kind: 'rename';

	/**
	 * The old (existing) location.
	 */
	oldUri: DocumentUri;

	/**
	 * The new location.
	 */
	newUri: DocumentUri;

	/**
	 * Rename options.
	 */
	options?: RenameFileOptions;

	/**
	 * An optional annotation identifer describing the operation.
	 *
	 * @since 3.16.0
	 */
	annotationId?: ChangeAnnotationIdentifier;
}

/**
 * Delete file options
 */
export interface DeleteFileOptions {
	/**
	 * Delete the content recursively if a folder is denoted.
	 */
	recursive?: boolean;

	/**
	 * Ignore the operation if the file doesn't exist.
	 */
	ignoreIfNotExists?: boolean;
}

/**
 * Delete file operation
 */
export interface DeleteFile {
	/**
	 * A delete
	 */
	kind: 'delete';

	/**
	 * The file to delete.
	 */
	uri: DocumentUri;

	/**
	 * Delete options.
	 */
	options?: DeleteFileOptions;

	/**
	 * An optional annotation identifer describing the operation.
	 *
	 * @since 3.16.0
	 */
	annotationId?: ChangeAnnotationIdentifier;
}
```

#### <a href="#workspaceEdit" name="workspaceEdit" class="anchor"> WorkspaceEdit </a>

A workspace edit represents changes to many resources managed in the workspace. The edit should either provide `changes` or `documentChanges`. If the client can handle versioned document edits and if `documentChanges` are present, the latter are preferred over `changes`.

 Since version 3.13.0 a workspace edit can contain resource operations (create, delete or rename files and folders) as well. If resource operations are present clients need to execute the operations in the order in which they are provided. So a workspace edit for example can consist of the following two changes: (1) create file a.txt and (2) a text document edit which insert text into file a.txt. An invalid sequence (e.g. (1) delete file a.txt and (2) insert text into file a.txt) will cause failure of the operation. How the client recovers from the failure is described by the client capability: `workspace.workspaceEdit.failureHandling`

```typescript
export interface WorkspaceEdit {
	/**
	 * Holds changes to existing resources.
	 */
	changes?: { [uri: DocumentUri]: TextEdit[]; };

	/**
	 * Depending on the client capability
	 * `workspace.workspaceEdit.resourceOperations` document changes are either
	 * an array of `TextDocumentEdit`s to express changes to n different text
	 * documents where each text document edit addresses a specific version of
	 * a text document. Or it can contain above `TextDocumentEdit`s mixed with
	 * create, rename and delete file / folder operations.
	 *
	 * Whether a client supports versioned document edits is expressed via
	 * `workspace.workspaceEdit.documentChanges` client capability.
	 *
	 * If a client neither supports `documentChanges` nor
	 * `workspace.workspaceEdit.resourceOperations` then only plain `TextEdit`s
	 * using the `changes` property are supported.
	 */
	documentChanges?: (
		TextDocumentEdit[] |
		(TextDocumentEdit | CreateFile | RenameFile | DeleteFile)[]
	);

	/**
	 * A map of change annotations that can be referenced in
	 * `AnnotatedTextEdit`s or create, rename and delete file / folder
	 * operations.
	 *
	 * Whether clients honor this property depends on the client capability
	 * `workspace.changeAnnotationSupport`.
	 *
	 * @since 3.16.0
	 */
	changeAnnotations?: {
		[id: string /* ChangeAnnotationIdentifier */]: ChangeAnnotation;
	};
}
```

##### <a href="#workspaceEditClientCapabilities" name="workspaceEditClientCapabilities" class="anchor"> WorkspaceEditClientCapabilities </a>

> New in version 3.13: `ResourceOperationKind` and `FailureHandlingKind` and the client capability `workspace.workspaceEdit.resourceOperations` as well as `workspace.workspaceEdit.failureHandling`.


The capabilities of a workspace edit has evolved over the time. Clients can describe their support using the following client capability:

* property path (optional): `workspace.workspaceEdit`
* property type: `WorkspaceEditClientCapabilities` defined as follows:

```typescript
export interface WorkspaceEditClientCapabilities {
	/**
	 * The client supports versioned document changes in `WorkspaceEdit`s
	 */
	documentChanges?: boolean;

	/**
	 * The resource operations the client supports. Clients should at least
	 * support 'create', 'rename' and 'delete' files and folders.
	 *
	 * @since 3.13.0
	 */
	resourceOperations?: ResourceOperationKind[];

	/**
	 * The failure handling strategy of a client if applying the workspace edit
	 * fails.
	 *
	 * @since 3.13.0
	 */
	failureHandling?: FailureHandlingKind;

	/**
	 * Whether the client normalizes line endings to the client specific
	 * setting.
	 * If set to `true` the client will normalize line ending characters
	 * in a workspace edit to the client specific new line character(s).
	 *
	 * @since 3.16.0
	 */
	normalizesLineEndings?: boolean;

	/**
	 * Whether the client in general supports change annotations on text edits,
	 * create file, rename file and delete file changes.
	 *
	 * @since 3.16.0
	 */
	changeAnnotationSupport?: {
		/**
		 * Whether the client groups edits with equal labels into tree nodes,
		 * for instance all edits labelled with "Changes in Strings" would
		 * be a tree node.
		 */
		groupsOnLabel?: boolean;
	};
}

/**
 * The kind of resource operations supported by the client.
 */
export type ResourceOperationKind = 'create' | 'rename' | 'delete';

export namespace ResourceOperationKind {

	/**
	 * Supports creating new files and folders.
	 */
	export const Create: ResourceOperationKind = 'create';

	/**
	 * Supports renaming existing files and folders.
	 */
	export const Rename: ResourceOperationKind = 'rename';

	/**
	 * Supports deleting existing files and folders.
	 */
	export const Delete: ResourceOperationKind = 'delete';
}

export type FailureHandlingKind = 'abort' | 'transactional' | 'undo'
	| 'textOnlyTransactional';

export namespace FailureHandlingKind {

	/**
	 * Applying the workspace change is simply aborted if one of the changes
	 * provided fails. All operations executed before the failing operation
	 * stay executed.
	 */
	export const Abort: FailureHandlingKind = 'abort';

	/**
	 * All operations are executed transactional. That means they either all
	 * succeed or no changes at all are applied to the workspace.
	 */
	export const Transactional: FailureHandlingKind = 'transactional';


	/**
	 * If the workspace edit contains only textual file changes they are
	 * executed transactional. If resource changes (create, rename or delete
	 * file) are part of the change the failure handling strategy is abort.
	 */
	export const TextOnlyTransactional: FailureHandlingKind
		= 'textOnlyTransactional';

	/**
	 * The client tries to undo the operations already executed. But there is no
	 * guarantee that this is succeeding.
	 */
	export const Undo: FailureHandlingKind = 'undo';
}
```

#### <a href="#textDocumentIdentifier" name="textDocumentIdentifier" class="anchor"> TextDocumentIdentifier </a>

Text documents are identified using a URI. On the protocol level, URIs are passed as strings. The corresponding JSON structure looks like this:
```typescript
interface TextDocumentIdentifier {
	/**
	 * The text document's URI.
	 */
	uri: DocumentUri;
}
```

#### <a href="#textDocumentItem" name="textDocumentItem" class="anchor"> TextDocumentItem </a>

An item to transfer a text document from the client to the server.

```typescript
interface TextDocumentItem {
	/**
	 * The text document's URI.
	 */
	uri: DocumentUri;

	/**
	 * The text document's language identifier.
	 */
	languageId: string;

	/**
	 * The version number of this document (it will increase after each
	 * change, including undo/redo).
	 */
	version: integer;

	/**
	 * The content of the opened text document.
	 */
	text: string;
}
```

Text documents have a language identifier to identify a document on the server side when it handles more than one language to avoid re-interpreting the file extension. If a document refers to one of the programming languages listed below it is recommended that clients use those ids.

#### <a href="#versionedTextDocumentIdentifier" name="versionedTextDocumentIdentifier" class="anchor"> VersionedTextDocumentIdentifier </a>

An identifier to denote a specific version of a text document. This information usually flows from the client to the server.

```typescript
interface VersionedTextDocumentIdentifier extends TextDocumentIdentifier {
	/**
	 * The version number of this document.
	 *
	 * The version number of a document will increase after each change,
	 * including undo/redo. The number doesn't need to be consecutive.
	 */
	version: integer;
}
```

An identifier which optionally denotes a specific version of a text document. This information usually flows from the server to the client.

```typescript
interface OptionalVersionedTextDocumentIdentifier extends TextDocumentIdentifier {
	/**
	 * The version number of this document. If an optional versioned text document
	 * identifier is sent from the server to the client and the file is not
	 * open in the editor (the server has not received an open notification
	 * before) the server can send `null` to indicate that the version is
	 * known and the content on disk is the master (as specified with document
	 * content ownership).
	 *
	 * The version number of a document will increase after each change,
	 * including undo/redo. The number doesn't need to be consecutive.
	 */
	version: integer | null;
}
```

#### <a href="#textDocumentPositionParams" name="textDocumentPositionParams" class="anchor"> TextDocumentPositionParams </a>

Was `TextDocumentPosition` in 1.0 with inlined parameters.

A parameter literal used in requests to pass a text document and a position inside that document. It is up to the client to decide how a selection is converted into a position when issuing a request for a text document. The client can for example honor or ignore the selection direction to make LSP request consistent with features implemented internally.

```typescript
interface TextDocumentPositionParams {
	/**
	 * The text document.
	 */
	textDocument: TextDocumentIdentifier;

	/**
	 * The position inside the text document.
	 */
	position: Position;
}
```

#### <a href="#documentFilter" name="documentFilter" class="anchor"> DocumentFilter </a>

A document filter denotes a document through properties like `language`, `scheme` or `pattern`. An example is a filter that applies to TypeScript files on disk. Another example is a filter the applies to JSON files with name `package.json`:
```typescript
{ language: 'typescript', scheme: 'file' }
{ language: 'json', pattern: '**/package.json' }
```

```typescript
export interface DocumentFilter {
	/**
	 * A language id, like `typescript`.
	 */
	language?: string;

	/**
	 * A Uri [scheme](#Uri.scheme), like `file` or `untitled`.
	 */
	scheme?: string;

	/**
	 * A glob pattern, like `*.{ts,js}`.
	 *
	 * Glob patterns can have the following syntax:
	 * - `*` to match one or more characters in a path segment
	 * - `?` to match on one character in a path segment
	 * - `**` to match any number of path segments, including none
	 * - `{}` to group sub patterns into an OR expression. (e.g. `**​/*.{ts,js}`
	 *   matches all TypeScript and JavaScript files)
	 * - `[]` to declare a range of characters to match in a path segment
	 *   (e.g., `example.[0-9]` to match on `example.0`, `example.1`, …)
	 * - `[!...]` to negate a range of characters to match in a path segment
	 *   (e.g., `example.[!0-9]` to match on `example.a`, `example.b`, but
	 *   not `example.0`)
	 */
	pattern?: string;
}
```

A document selector is the combination of one or more document filters.

```typescript
export type DocumentSelector = DocumentFilter[];
```

#### <a href="#staticRegistrationOptions" name="staticRegistrationOptions" class="anchor"> StaticRegistrationOptions </a>

Static registration options can be used to register a feature in the initialize result with a given server control ID to be able to un-register the feature later on.

```typescript
/**
 * Static registration options to be returned in the initialize request.
 */
export interface StaticRegistrationOptions {
	/**
	 * The id used to register the request. The id can be used to deregister
	 * the request again. See also Registration#id.
	 */
	id?: string;
}
```

#### <a href="#textDocumentRegistrationOptions" name="textDocumentRegistrationOptions" class="anchor"> TextDocumentRegistrationOptions </a>

Options to dynamically register for requests for a set of text documents.

```typescript
/**
 * General text document registration options.
 */
export interface TextDocumentRegistrationOptions {
	/**
	 * A document selector to identify the scope of the registration. If set to
	 * null the document selector provided on the client side will be used.
	 */
	documentSelector: DocumentSelector | null;
}
```

#### <a href="#markupContent" name="markupContent" class="anchor"> MarkupContent </a>

 A `MarkupContent` literal represents a string value which content can be represented in different formats. Currently `plaintext` and `markdown` are supported formats. A `MarkupContent` is usually used in documentation properties of result literals like `CompletionItem` or `SignatureInformation`. If the format is `markdown` the content should follow the [GitHub Flavored Markdown Specification](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

```typescript
/**
 * Describes the content type that a client supports in various
 * result literals like `Hover`, `ParameterInfo` or `CompletionItem`.
 *
 * Please note that `MarkupKinds` must not start with a `$`. This kinds
 * are reserved for internal usage.
 */
export namespace MarkupKind {
	/**
	 * Plain text is supported as a content format
	 */
	export const PlainText: 'plaintext' = 'plaintext';

	/**
	 * Markdown is supported as a content format
	 */
	export const Markdown: 'markdown' = 'markdown';
}
export type MarkupKind = 'plaintext' | 'markdown';

/**
 * A `MarkupContent` literal represents a string value which content is
 * interpreted base on its kind flag. Currently the protocol supports
 * `plaintext` and `markdown` as markup kinds.
 *
 * If the kind is `markdown` then the value can contain fenced code blocks like
 * in GitHub issues.
 *
 * Here is an example how such a string can be constructed using
 * JavaScript / TypeScript:
 * ```typescript
 * let markdown: MarkdownContent = {
 * 	kind: MarkupKind.Markdown,
 * 	value: [
 * 		'# Header',
 * 		'Some text',
 * 		'```typescript',
 * 		'someCode();',
 * 		'```'
 * 	].join('\n')
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * *Please Note* that clients might sanitize the return markdown. A client could
 * decide to remove HTML from the markdown to avoid script execution.
 */
export interface MarkupContent {
	/**
	 * The type of the Markup
	 */
	kind: MarkupKind;

	/**
	 * The content itself
	 */
	value: string;
}
```

In addition clients should signal the markdown parser they are using via the client capability `general.markdown` introduced in version 3.16.0 defined as follows:

 ```typescript
/**
 * Client capabilities specific to the used markdown parser.
 *
 * @since 3.16.0
 */
export interface MarkdownClientCapabilities {
	/**
	 * The name of the parser.
	 */
	parser: string;

	/**
	 * The version of the parser.
	 */
	version?: string;
}
 ```

Known markdown parsers used by clients right now are:

#### <a href="#workDoneProgress" name="workDoneProgress" class="anchor"> Work Done Progress </a>

> *Since version 3.15.0*

Work done progress is reported using the generic [`$/progress`](#progress) notification. The value payload of a work done progress notification can be of three different forms.

##### <a href="#workDoneProgressBegin" name="workDoneProgressBegin" class="anchor"> Work Done Progress Begin </a>

To start progress reporting a `$/progress` notification with the following payload must be sent:

```typescript
export interface WorkDoneProgressBegin {

	kind: 'begin';

	/**
	 * Mandatory title of the progress operation. Used to briefly inform about
	 * the kind of operation being performed.
	 *
	 * Examples: "Indexing" or "Linking dependencies".
	 */
	title: string;

	/**
	 * Controls if a cancel button should show to allow the user to cancel the
	 * long running operation. Clients that don't support cancellation are
	 * allowed to ignore the setting.
	 */
	cancellable?: boolean;

	/**
	 * Optional, more detailed associated progress message. Contains
	 * complementary information to the `title`.
	 *
	 * Examples: "3/25 files", "project/src/module2", "node_modules/some_dep".
	 * If unset, the previous progress message (if any) is still valid.
	 */
	message?: string;

	/**
	 * Optional progress percentage to display (value 100 is considered 100%).
	 * If not provided infinite progress is assumed and clients are allowed
	 * to ignore the `percentage` value in subsequent in report notifications.
	 *
	 * The value should be steadily rising. Clients are free to ignore values
	 * that are not following this rule. The value range is [0, 100]
	 */
	percentage?: uinteger;
}
```

##### <a href="#workDoneProgressReport" name="workDoneProgressReport" class="anchor"> Work Done Progress Report </a>

Reporting progress is done using the following payload:

```typescript
export interface WorkDoneProgressReport {

	kind: 'report';

	/**
	 * Controls enablement state of a cancel button. This property is only valid
	 * if a cancel button got requested in the `WorkDoneProgressBegin` payload.
	 *
	 * Clients that don't support cancellation or don't support control the
	 * button's enablement state are allowed to ignore the setting.
	 */
	cancellable?: boolean;

	/**
	 * Optional, more detailed associated progress message. Contains
	 * complementary information to the `title`.
	 *
	 * Examples: "3/25 files", "project/src/module2", "node_modules/some_dep".
	 * If unset, the previous progress message (if any) is still valid.
	 */
	message?: string;

	/**
	 * Optional progress percentage to display (value 100 is considered 100%).
	 * If not provided infinite progress is assumed and clients are allowed
	 * to ignore the `percentage` value in subsequent in report notifications.
	 *
	 * The value should be steadily rising. Clients are free to ignore values
	 * that are not following this rule. The value range is [0, 100]
	 */
	percentage?: uinteger;
}
```

##### <a href="#workDoneProgressEnd" name="workDoneProgressEnd" class="anchor"> Work Done Progress End </a>

Signaling the end of a progress reporting is done using the following payload:

```typescript
export interface WorkDoneProgressEnd {

	kind: 'end';

	/**
	 * Optional, a final message indicating to for example indicate the outcome
	 * of the operation.
	 */
	message?: string;
}
```

##### <a href="#initiatingWorkDoneProgress" name="initiatingWorkDoneProgress" class="anchor"> Initiating Work Done Progress </a>

Work Done progress can be initiated in two different ways:

1. by the sender of a request (mostly clients) using the predefined `workDoneToken` property in the requests parameter literal. The document will refer to this kind of progress as client initiated progress.
1. by a server using the request `window/workDoneProgress/create`. The document will refer to this kind of progress as server initiated progress.

###### <a href="#clientInitiatedProgress" name="clientInitiatedProgress" class="anchor">Client Initiated Progress </a>

Consider a client sending a `textDocument/reference` request to a server and the client accepts work done progress reporting on that request. To signal this to the server the client would add a `workDoneToken` property to the reference request parameters. Something like this:

```json
{
	"textDocument": {
		"uri": "file:///folder/file.ts"
	},
	"position": {
		"line": 9,
		"character": 5
	},
	"context": {
		"includeDeclaration": true
	},
	// The token used to report work done progress.
	"workDoneToken": "1d546990-40a3-4b77-b134-46622995f6ae"
}
```

The corresponding type definition for the parameter property looks like this:

```typescript
export interface WorkDoneProgressParams {
	/**
	 * An optional token that a server can use to report work done progress.
	 */
	workDoneToken?: ProgressToken;
}
```

A server uses the `workDoneToken` to report progress for the specific `textDocument/reference`. For the above request the `$/progress` notification params look like this:

```json
{
	"token": "1d546990-40a3-4b77-b134-46622995f6ae",
	"value": {
		"kind": "begin",
		"title": "Finding references for A#foo",
		"cancellable": false,
		"message": "Processing file X.ts",
		"percentage": 0
	}
}
```

The token received via the `workDoneToken` property in a request's param literal is only valid as long as the request has not send a response back.

There is no specific client capability signaling whether a client will send a progress token per request. The reason for this is that this is in many clients not a static aspect and might even change for every request instance for the same request type. So the capability is signal on every request instance by the presence of a `workDoneToken` property.

To avoid that clients set up a progress monitor user interface before sending a request but the server doesn't actually report any progress a server needs to signal general work done progress reporting support in the corresponding server capability. For the above find references example a server would signal such a support by setting the `referencesProvider` property in the server capabilities as follows:

```json
{
	"referencesProvider": {
		"workDoneProgress": true
	}
}
```

The corresponding type definition for the server capability looks like this:

```typescript
export interface WorkDoneProgressOptions {
	workDoneProgress?: boolean;
}
```
###### <a href="#serverInitiatedProgress" name="serverInitiatedProgress" class="anchor">Server Initiated Progress </a>

Servers can also initiate progress reporting using the `window/workDoneProgress/create` request. This is useful if the server needs to report progress outside of a request (for example the server needs to re-index a database). The returned token can then be used to report progress using the same notifications used as for client initiated progress. A token obtained using the create request should only be used once (e.g. only one begin, many report and one end notification should be sent to it).

To keep the protocol backwards compatible servers are only allowed to use `window/workDoneProgress/create` request if the client signals corresponding support using the client capability `window.workDoneProgress` which is defined as follows:

```typescript
	/**
	 * Window specific client capabilities.
	 */
	window?: {
		/**
		 * Whether client supports server initiated progress using the
		 * `window/workDoneProgress/create` request.
		 */
		workDoneProgress?: boolean;
	};
```

#### <a href="#partialResults" name="partialResults" class="anchor"> Partial Result Progress </a>

> *Since version 3.15.0*

Partial results are also reported using the generic [`$/progress`](#progress) notification. The value payload of a partial result progress notification is in most cases the same as the final result. For example the `workspace/symbol` request has `SymbolInformation[]` as the result type. Partial result is therefore also of type `SymbolInformation[]`. Whether a client accepts partial result notifications for a request is signaled by adding a `partialResultToken` to the request parameter. For example, a `textDocument/reference` request that supports both work done and partial result progress might look like this:

```json
{
	"textDocument": {
		"uri": "file:///folder/file.ts"
	},
	"position": {
		"line": 9,
		"character": 5
	},
	"context": {
		"includeDeclaration": true
	},
	// The token used to report work done progress.
	"workDoneToken": "1d546990-40a3-4b77-b134-46622995f6ae",
	// The token used to report partial result progress.
	"partialResultToken": "5f6f349e-4f81-4a3b-afff-ee04bff96804"
}
```

The `partialResultToken` is then used to report partial results for the find references request.

If a server reports partial result via a corresponding `$/progress`, the whole result must be reported using n `$/progress` notifications. The final response has to be empty in terms of result values. This avoids confusion about how the final result should be interpreted, e.g. as another partial result or as a replacing result.

If the response errors the provided partial results should be treated as follows:

- the `code` equals to `RequestCancelled`: the client is free to use the provided results but should make clear that the request got canceled and may be incomplete.
- in all other cases the provided partial results shouldn't be used.

#### <a href="#partialResultParams" name="partialResultParams" class="anchor"> PartialResultParams </a>

A parameter literal used to pass a partial result token.

```typescript
export interface PartialResultParams {
	/**
	 * An optional token that a server can use to report partial results (e.g.
	 * streaming) to the client.
	 */
	partialResultToken?: ProgressToken;
}
```

#### <a href="#traceValue" name="traceValue" class="anchor"> TraceValue </a>

A `TraceValue` represents the level of verbosity with which the server systematically reports its execution trace using [$/logTrace](#logTrace) notifications.
The initial trace value is set by the client at initialization and can be modified later using the [$/setTrace](#setTrace) notification.

```typescript
export type TraceValue = 'off' | 'message' | 'verbose';
```

### Actual Protocol

This section documents the actual language server protocol. It uses the following format:

* a header describing the request
* an optional _Client capability_ section describing the client capability of the request. This includes the client capabilities property path and JSON structure.
* an optional _Server Capability_ section describing the server capability of the request. This includes the server capabilities property path and JSON structure. Clients should ignore server capabilities they don't understand (e.g. the initialize request shouldn't fail in this case).
* an optional _Registration Options_ section describing the registration option if the request or notification supports dynamic capability registration. See the [register](#client_registerCapability) and [unregister](#client_unregisterCapability) request for how this works in detail.
* a _Request_ section describing the format of the request sent. The method is a string identifying the request the params are documented using a TypeScript interface. It is also documented whether the request supports work done progress and partial result progress.
* a _Response_ section describing the format of the response. The result item describes the returned data in case of a success. The optional partial result item describes the returned data of a partial result notification. The error.data describes the returned data in case of an error. Please remember that in case of a failure the response already contains an error.code and an error.message field. These fields are only specified if the protocol forces the use of certain error codes or messages. In cases where the server can decide on these values freely they aren't listed here.

#### Request, Notification and Response ordering

Responses to requests should be sent in roughly the same order as the requests appear on the server or client side. So for example if a server receives a `textDocument/completion` request and then a `textDocument/signatureHelp` request it will usually first return the response for the `textDocument/completion` and then the response for `textDocument/signatureHelp`.

However, the server may decide to use a parallel execution strategy and may wish to return responses in a different order than the requests were received. The server may do so as long as this reordering doesn't affect the correctness of the responses. For example, reordering the result of `textDocument/completion` and `textDocument/signatureHelp` is allowed, as these each of these requests usually won't affect the output of the other. On the other hand, the server most likely should not reorder `textDocument/definition` and `textDocument/rename` requests, since the executing the latter may affect the result of the former.

#### Core Client capabilities 

The core client capabilities represent the two primary LSP namespaces that exist on the `ClientCapabilities` type handed to language servers when initializing.


##### TextDocumentClientCapabilities

```

##### <a href="#workspace_workspaceFolders" name="workspace_workspaceFolders" class="anchor">Workspace folders request (:arrow_right_hook:)</a>

> *Since version 3.6.0*

Many tools support more than one root folder per workspace. Examples for this are VS Code's multi-root support, Atom's project folder support or Sublime's project support. If a client workspace consists of multiple roots then a server typically needs to know about this. The protocol up to now assumes one root folder which is announced to the server by the `rootUri` property of the `InitializeParams`. If the client supports workspace folders and announces them via the corresponding `workspaceFolders` client capability, the `InitializeParams` contain an additional property `workspaceFolders` with the configured workspace folders when the server starts.

The `workspace/workspaceFolders` request is sent from the server to the client to fetch the current open list of workspace folders. Returns `null` in the response if only a single file is open in the tool. Returns an empty array if a workspace is open but no folders are configured.

_Client Capability_:
* property path (optional): `workspace.workspaceFolders`
* property type: `boolean`

##### <a href="#workspace_didChangeWorkspaceFolders" name="workspace_didChangeWorkspaceFolders" class="anchor">DidChangeWorkspaceFolders Notification (:arrow_right:)</a>

> *Since version 3.6.0*

The `workspace/didChangeWorkspaceFolders` notification is sent from the client to the server to inform the server about workspace folder configuration changes. The notification is sent by default if both _client capability_ `workspace.workspaceFolders` and the _server capability_ `workspace.workspaceFolders.supported` are true; or if the server has registered itself to receive this notification. To register for the `workspace/didChangeWorkspaceFolders` send a `client/registerCapability` request from the server to the client. The registration parameter must have a `registrations` item of the following form, where `id` is a unique id used to unregister the capability (the example uses a UUID):
```ts
{
	id: "28c6150c-bd7b-11e7-abc4-cec278b6b50a",
	method: "workspace/didChangeWorkspaceFolders"

```

#### <a href="#workspace_configuration" name="workspace_configuration" class="anchor">Configuration Request (:arrow_right_hook:)</a>

> *Since version 3.6.0*

The `workspace/configuration` request is sent from the server to the client to fetch configuration settings from the client. The request can fetch several configuration settings in one roundtrip. The order of the returned configuration settings correspond to the order of the passed `ConfigurationItems` (e.g. the first item in the response is the result for the first configuration item in the params).

A `ConfigurationItem` consists of the configuration section to ask for and an additional scope URI. The configuration section asked for is defined by the server and doesn't necessarily need to correspond to the configuration store used by the client. So a server might ask for a configuration `cpp.formatterOptions` but the client stores the configuration in an XML store layout differently. It is up to the client to do the necessary conversion. If a scope URI is provided the client should return the setting scoped to the provided resource. If the client for example uses [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) to manage its settings the configuration should be returned for the passed resource URI. If the client can't provide a configuration setting for a given scope then `null` needs to be present in the returned array.

* property path (optional): `workspace.configuration`

#### <a href="#workspace_didChangeWatchedFiles" name="workspace_didChangeWatchedFiles" class="anchor">DidChangeWatchedFiles Notification (:arrow_right:)</a>

The watched files notification is sent from the client to the server when the client detects changes to files and folders watched by the language client (note although the name suggest that only file events are sent it is about file system events which include folders as well). It is recommended that servers register for these file system events using the registration mechanism. In former implementations clients pushed file events without the server actively asking for it.

Servers are allowed to run their own file system watching mechanism and not rely on clients to provide file system events. However this is not recommended due to the following reasons:

- to our experience getting file system watching on disk right is challenging, especially if it needs to be supported across multiple OSes.
- file system watching is not for free especially if the implementation uses some sort of polling and keeps a file system tree in memory to compare time stamps (as for example some node modules do)
- a client usually starts more than one server. If every server runs its own file system watching it can become a CPU or memory problem.
- in general there are more server than client implementations. So this problem is better solved on the client side.

The document's content is now managed by the client and the server must not try to read the document's content using the document's Uri. Open in this sense means it is managed by the client. It doesn't necessarily mean that its content is presented in an editor. An open notification must not be sent more than once without a corresponding close notification send before. This means open and close notification must be balanced and the max open count for a particular textDocument is one. Note that a server's ability to fulfill requests is independent of whether a text document is open or closed.

The `DidOpenTextDocumentParams` contain the language id the document is associated with. If the language Id of a document changes, the client needs to send a `textDocument/didClose` to the server followed by a `textDocument/didOpen` with the new language id if the server handles the new language id as well.

#### <a href="#textDocument_didChange" name="textDocument_didChange" class="anchor">DidChangeTextDocument Notification (:arrow_right:)</a>

The document change notification is sent from the client to the server to signal changes to a text document.

```

#### <a href="#textDocument_didClose" name="textDocument_didClose" class="anchor">DidCloseTextDocument Notification (:arrow_right:)</a>

The document close notification is sent from the client to the server when the document got closed in the client. The document's master now exists where the document's Uri points to (e.g. if the document's Uri is a file Uri the master now exists on disk). As with the open notification the close notification is about managing the document's content. Receiving a close notification doesn't mean that the document was open in an editor before. A close notification requires a previous open notification to be sent. Note that a server's ability to fulfill requests is independent of whether a text document is open or closed.

#### <a href="#textDocument_publishDiagnostics" name="textDocument_publishDiagnostics" class="anchor">PublishDiagnostics Notification (:arrow_left:)</a>

Diagnostics notification are sent from the server to the client to signal results of validation runs.

Diagnostics are "owned" by the server so it is the server's responsibility to clear them if necessary. The following rule is used for VS Code servers that generate diagnostics:

* if a language is single file only (for example HTML) then diagnostics are cleared by the server when the file is closed. Please note that open / close events don't necessarily reflect what the user sees in the user interface. These events are ownership events. So with the current version of the specification it is possible that problems are not cleared although the file is not visible in the user interface since the client has not closed the file yet.
* if a language has a project system (for example C#) diagnostics are not cleared when a file closes. When a project is opened all diagnostics for all files are recomputed (or read from a cache).

When a file changes it is the server's responsibility to re-compute diagnostics and push them to the client. If the computed set is empty it has to push the empty array to clear former diagnostics. Newly pushed diagnostics always replace previously pushed diagnostics. There is no merging that happens on the client side.

See also the [Diagnostic](#diagnostic) section.

_Client Capability_:
* property name (optional): `textDocument.publishDiagnostics`
* property type `PublishDiagnosticsClientCapabilities` defined as follows:

```typescript
export interface PublishDiagnosticsClientCapabilities {

#### <a href="#textDocument_completion" name="textDocument_completion" class="anchor">Completion Request (:leftwards_arrow_with_hook:)</a>

The Completion request is sent from the client to the server to compute completion items at a given cursor position. Completion items are presented in the [IntelliSense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense) user interface. If computing full completion items is expensive, servers can additionally provide a handler for the completion item resolve request ('completionItem/resolve'). This request is sent when a completion item is selected in the user interface. A typical use case is for example: the 'textDocument/completion' request doesn't fill in the `documentation` property for returned completion items since it is expensive to compute. When the item is selected in the user interface then a 'completionItem/resolve' request is sent with the selected completion item as a parameter. The returned completion item should have the documentation property filled in. By default the request can only delay the computation of the `detail` and `documentation` properties. Since 3.16.0 the client
can signal that it can resolve more properties lazily. This is done using the `completionItem#resolveSupport` client capability which lists all properties that can be filled in during a 'completionItem/resolve' request. All other properties (usually `sortText`, `filterText`, `insertText` and `textEdit`) must be provided in the `textDocument/completion` response and must not be changed during resolve.

Completion items support snippets (see `InsertTextFormat.Snippet`). The snippet format is as follows:

##### <a href="#snippet_syntax" name="snippet_syntax" class="anchor">Snippet Syntax</a>

The `body` of a snippet can use special constructs to control cursors and the text being inserted. The following are supported features and their syntaxes:

##### Tab stops

With tab stops, you can make the editor cursor move inside a snippet. Use `$1`, `$2` to specify cursor locations. The number is the order in which tab stops will be visited, whereas `$0` denotes the final cursor position. Multiple tab stops are linked and updated in sync.

##### Placeholders

Placeholders are tab stops with values, like `${1:foo}`. The placeholder text will be inserted and selected such that it can be easily changed. Placeholders can be nested, like `${1:another ${2:placeholder}}`.

##### Choice

Placeholders can have choices as values. The syntax is a comma separated enumeration of values, enclosed with the pipe-character, for example `${1|one,two,three|}`. When the snippet is inserted and the placeholder selected, choices will prompt the user to pick one of the values.

##### Variables

With `$name` or `${name:default}` you can insert the value of a variable. When a variable isn’t set, its *default* or the empty string is inserted. When a variable is unknown (that is, its name isn’t defined) the name of the variable is inserted and it is transformed into a placeholder.

The following variables can be used:

* `TM_SELECTED_TEXT` The currently selected text or the empty string
* `TM_CURRENT_LINE` The contents of the current line
* `TM_CURRENT_WORD` The contents of the word under cursor or the empty string
* `TM_LINE_INDEX` The zero-index based line number
* `TM_LINE_NUMBER` The one-index based line number
* `TM_FILENAME` The filename of the current document
* `TM_FILENAME_BASE` The filename of the current document without its extensions
* `TM_DIRECTORY` The directory of the current document
* `TM_FILEPATH` The full file path of the current document

##### Variable Transforms

Transformations allow you to modify the value of a variable before it is inserted. The definition of a transformation consists of three parts:

1. A [regular expression](#regExp) that is matched against the value of a variable, or the empty string when the variable cannot be resolved.
2. A "format string" that allows to reference matching groups from the regular expression. The format string allows for conditional inserts and simple modifications.
3. Options that are passed to the regular expression.

The following example inserts the name of the current file without its ending, so from `foo.txt` it makes `foo`.

```
${TM_FILENAME/(.*)\..+$/$1/}
  |           |         | |
  |           |         | |-> no options
  |           |         |
  |           |         |-> references the contents of the first
  |           |             capture group
  |           |
  |           |-> regex to capture everything before
  |               the final `.suffix`
  |
  |-> resolves to the filename
```

##### Grammar

Below is the EBNF ([extended Backus-Naur form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus-Naur_form)) for snippets. With `\` (backslash), you can escape `$`, `}` and `\`. Within choice elements, the backslash also escapes comma and pipe characters.

```
any         ::= tabstop | placeholder | choice | variable | text
tabstop     ::= '$' int | '${' int '}'
placeholder ::= '${' int ':' any '}'
choice      ::= '${' int '|' text (',' text)* '|}'
variable    ::= '$' var | '${' var }'
                | '${' var ':' any '}'
                | '${' var '/' regex '/' (format | text)+ '/' options '}'
format      ::= '$' int | '${' int '}'
                | '${' int ':' '/upcase' | '/downcase' | '/capitalize' '}'
                | '${' int ':+' if '}'
                | '${' int ':?' if ':' else '}'
                | '${' int ':-' else '}' | '${' int ':' else '}'
regex       ::= Regular Expression value (ctor-string)
options     ::= Regular Expression option (ctor-options)
var         ::= [_a-zA-Z] [_a-zA-Z0-9]*
int         ::= [0-9]+
text        ::= .*

#### <a href="#textDocument_codeAction" name="textDocument_codeAction" class="anchor">Code Action Request (:leftwards_arrow_with_hook:)</a>

The code action request is sent from the client to the server to compute commands for a given text document and range. These commands are typically code fixes to either fix problems or to beautify/refactor code. The result of a `textDocument/codeAction` request is an array of `Command` literals which are typically presented in the user interface. To ensure that a server is useful in many clients the commands specified in a code actions should be handled by the server and not by the client (see `workspace/executeCommand` and `ServerCapabilities.executeCommandProvider`). If the client supports providing edits with a code action then that mode should be used.

*Since version 3.16.0:* a client can offer a server to delay the computation of code action properties during a 'textDocument/codeAction' request:

This is useful for cases where it is expensive to compute the value of a property (for example the `edit` property). Clients signal this through the `codeAction.resolveSupport` capability which lists all properties a client can resolve lazily. The server capability `codeActionProvider.resolveProvider` signals that a server will offer a `codeAction/resolve` route. To help servers to uniquely identify a code action in the resolve request, a code action literal can optional carry a data property. This is also guarded by an additional client capability `codeAction.dataSupport`. In general, a client should offer data support if it offers resolve support. It should also be noted that servers shouldn't alter existing attributes of a code action in a codeAction/resolve request.

> *Since version 3.8.0:* support for CodeAction literals to enable the following scenarios:

- the ability to directly return a workspace edit from the code action request. This avoids having another server roundtrip to execute an actual code action. However server providers should be aware that if the code action is expensive to compute or the edits are huge it might still be beneficial if the result is simply a command and the actual edit is only computed when needed.
- the ability to group code actions using a kind. Clients are allowed to ignore that information. However it allows them to better group code action for example into corresponding menus (e.g. all refactor code actions into a refactor menu).

Clients need to announce their support for code action literals (e.g. literals of type `CodeAction`) and code action kinds via the corresponding client capability `codeAction.codeActionLiteralSupport`.

The request is sent from the client to the server to resolve additional information for a given code action. This is usually used to compute
the `edit` property of a code action to avoid its unnecessary computation during the `textDocument/codeAction` request.

Consider the clients announces the `edit` property as a property that can be resolved lazy using the client capability

```typescript
textDocument.codeAction.resolveSupport = { properties: ['edit'] };
```

then a code action

```typescript
{
    "title": "Do Foo"
}
```

needs to be resolved using the `codeAction/resolve` request before it can be applied.

> *Since version 3.16.0*

The request is sent from the client to the server to resolve semantic tokens for a given file. Semantic tokens are used to add additional color information to a file that depends on language specific symbol information. A semantic token request usually produces a large result. The protocol therefore supports encoding tokens with numbers. In addition optional support for deltas is available.

_General Concepts_

Tokens are represented using one token type combined with n token modifiers. A token type is something like `class` or `function` and token modifiers are like `static` or `async`. The protocol defines a set of token types and modifiers but clients are allowed to extend these and announce the values they support in the corresponding client capability. The predefined values are:

```typescript
export enum SemanticTokenTypes {
	namespace = 'namespace',
	/**
	 * Represents a generic type. Acts as a fallback for types which
	 * can't be mapped to a specific type like class or enum.
	 */
	type = 'type',
	class = 'class',
	enum = 'enum',
	interface = 'interface',
	struct = 'struct',
	typeParameter = 'typeParameter',
	parameter = 'parameter',
	variable = 'variable',
	property = 'property',
	enumMember = 'enumMember',
	event = 'event',
	function = 'function',
	method = 'method',
	macro = 'macro',
	keyword = 'keyword',
	modifier = 'modifier',
	comment = 'comment',
	string = 'string',
	number = 'number',
	regexp = 'regexp',
	operator = 'operator'
}

export enum SemanticTokenModifiers {
	declaration = 'declaration',
	definition = 'definition',
	readonly = 'readonly',
	static = 'static',
	deprecated = 'deprecated',
	abstract = 'abstract',
	async = 'async',
	modification = 'modification',
	documentation = 'documentation',
	defaultLibrary = 'defaultLibrary'
}
```

The protocol defines an additional token format capability to allow future extensions of the format. The only format that is currently specified is `relative` expressing that the tokens are described using relative positions (see Integer Encoding for Tokens below).

```typescript
export namespace TokenFormat {
	export const Relative: 'relative' = 'relative';
}

export type TokenFormat = 'relative';
```

_Integer Encoding for Tokens_

On the capability level types and modifiers are defined using strings. However the real encoding happens using numbers. The server therefore needs to let the client know which numbers it is using for which types and modifiers. They do so using a legend, which is defined as follows:

```typescript
export interface SemanticTokensLegend {
	/**
	 * The token types a server uses.
	 */
	tokenTypes: string[];

	/**
	 * The token modifiers a server uses.
	 */
	tokenModifiers: string[];
}
```

Token types are looked up by index, so a `tokenType` value of `1` means `tokenTypes[1]`. Since a token type can have n modifiers, multiple token modifiers can be set by using bit flags,
so a `tokenModifier` value of `3` is first viewed as binary `0b00000011`, which means `[tokenModifiers[0], tokenModifiers[1]]` because bits 0 and 1 are set.

There are different ways how the position of a token can be expressed in a file. Absolute positions or relative positions. The protocol for the token format `relative` uses relative positions, because most tokens remain stable relative to each other when edits are made in a file. This simplifies the computation of a delta if a server supports it. So each token is represented using 5 integers. A specific token `i` in the file consists of the following array indices:

- at index `5*i`   - `deltaLine`: token line number, relative to the previous token
- at index `5*i+1` - `deltaStart`: token start character, relative to the previous token (relative to 0 or the previous token's start if they are on the same line)
- at index `5*i+2` - `length`: the length of the token.
- at index `5*i+3` - `tokenType`: will be looked up in `SemanticTokensLegend.tokenTypes`. We currently ask that `tokenType` < 65536.
- at index `5*i+4` - `tokenModifiers`: each set bit will be looked up in `SemanticTokensLegend.tokenModifiers`

Whether a token can span multiple lines is defined by the client capability `multilineTokenSupport`. The client capability `overlappingTokenSupport` defines whether tokens can overlap each other.

Lets look at a concrete example which uses single line tokens without overlaps for encoding a file with 3 tokens in a number array. We start with absolute positions to demonstrate how they can easily be transformed into relative positions:

```typescript
{ line: 2, startChar:  5, length: 3, tokenType: "property",
	tokenModifiers: ["private", "static"]
},
{ line: 2, startChar: 10, length: 4, tokenType: "type", tokenModifiers: [] },
{ line: 5, startChar:  2, length: 7, tokenType: "class", tokenModifiers: [] }
```

First of all, a legend must be devised. This legend must be provided up-front on registration and capture all possible token types and modifiers. For the example we use this legend:

```typescript
{
   tokenTypes: ['property', 'type', 'class'],
   tokenModifiers: ['private', 'static']
}
```

The first transformation step is to encode `tokenType` and `tokenModifiers` as integers using the legend. As said, token types are looked up by index, so a `tokenType` value of `1` means `tokenTypes[1]`. Multiple token modifiers can be set by using bit flags, so a `tokenModifier` value of `3` is first viewed as binary `0b00000011`, which means `[tokenModifiers[0], tokenModifiers[1]]` because bits 0 and 1 are set. Using this legend, the tokens now are:

```typescript
{ line: 2, startChar:  5, length: 3, tokenType: 0, tokenModifiers: 3 },
{ line: 2, startChar: 10, length: 4, tokenType: 1, tokenModifiers: 0 },
{ line: 5, startChar:  2, length: 7, tokenType: 2, tokenModifiers: 0 }
```

The next step is to represent each token relative to the previous token in the file. In this case, the second token is on the same line as the first token, so the `startChar` of the second token is made relative to the `startChar` of the first token, so it will be `10 - 5`. The third token is on a different line than the second token, so the `startChar` of the third token will not be altered:

```typescript
{ deltaLine: 2, deltaStartChar: 5, length: 3, tokenType: 0, tokenModifiers: 3 },
{ deltaLine: 0, deltaStartChar: 5, length: 4, tokenType: 1, tokenModifiers: 0 },
{ deltaLine: 3, deltaStartChar: 2, length: 7, tokenType: 2, tokenModifiers: 0 }
```

Finally, the last step is to inline each of the 5 fields for a token in a single array, which is a memory friendly representation:

```typescript
// 1st token,  2nd token,  3rd token
[  2,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ]
```

Now assume that the user types a new empty line at the beginning of the file which results in the following tokens in the file:

```typescript
{ line: 3, startChar:  5, length: 3, tokenType: "property",
	tokenModifiers: ["private", "static"]
},
{ line: 3, startChar: 10, length: 4, tokenType: "type", tokenModifiers: [] },
{ line: 6, startChar:  2, length: 7, tokenType: "class", tokenModifiers: [] }
```

Running the same transformations as above will result in the following number array:

```typescript
// 1st token,  2nd token,  3rd token
[  3,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0]
```

The delta is now expressed on these number arrays without any form of interpretation what these numbers mean. This is comparable to the text document edits send from the server to the client to modify the content of a file. Those are character based and don't make any assumption about the meaning of the characters. So `[  2,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ]` can be transformed into `[  3,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0]` using the following edit description: `{ start:  0, deleteCount: 1, data: [3] }` which tells the client to simply replace the first number (e.g. `2`) in the array with `3`.


_Client Capability_:

The following client capabilities are defined for semantic token requests sent from the client to the server:

* property name (optional): `textDocument.semanticTokens`
* property type: `SemanticTokensClientCapabilities` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface SemanticTokensClientCapabilities {
	/**
	 * Whether implementation supports dynamic registration. If this is set to
	 * `true` the client supports the new `(TextDocumentRegistrationOptions &
	 * StaticRegistrationOptions)` return value for the corresponding server
	 * capability as well.
	 */
	dynamicRegistration?: boolean;

	/**
	 * Which requests the client supports and might send to the server
	 * depending on the server's capability. Please note that clients might not
	 * show semantic tokens or degrade some of the user experience if a range
	 * or full request is advertised by the client but not provided by the
	 * server. If for example the client capability `requests.full` and
	 * `request.range` are both set to true but the server only provides a
	 * range provider the client might not render a minimap correctly or might
	 * even decide to not show any semantic tokens at all.
	 */
	requests: {
		/**
		 * The client will send the `textDocument/semanticTokens/range` request
		 * if the server provides a corresponding handler.
		 */
		range?: boolean | {
		};

		/**
		 * The client will send the `textDocument/semanticTokens/full` request
		 * if the server provides a corresponding handler.
		 */
		full?: boolean | {
			/**
			 * The client will send the `textDocument/semanticTokens/full/delta`
			 * request if the server provides a corresponding handler.
			 */
			delta?: boolean
		};
	};

	/**
	 * The token types that the client supports.
	 */
	tokenTypes: string[];

	/**
	 * The token modifiers that the client supports.
	 */
	tokenModifiers: string[];

	/**
	 * The formats the clients supports.
	 */
	formats: TokenFormat[];

	/**
	 * Whether the client supports tokens that can overlap each other.
	 */
	overlappingTokenSupport?: boolean;

	/**
	 * Whether the client supports tokens that can span multiple lines.
	 */
	multilineTokenSupport?: boolean;
}
```

_Server Capability_:

The following server capabilities are defined for semantic tokens:

* property name (optional): `semanticTokensProvider`
* property type: `SemanticTokensOptions | SemanticTokensRegistrationOptions` where `SemanticTokensOptions` is defined as follows:

```typescript
export interface SemanticTokensOptions extends WorkDoneProgressOptions {
	/**
	 * The legend used by the server
	 */
	legend: SemanticTokensLegend;

	/**
	 * Server supports providing semantic tokens for a specific range
	 * of a document.
	 */
	range?: boolean | {
	};

	/**
	 * Server supports providing semantic tokens for a full document.
	 */
	full?: boolean | {
		/**
		 * The server supports deltas for full documents.
		 */
		delta?: boolean;
	};
}
```

_Registration Options_: `SemanticTokensRegistrationOptions` defined as follows:

```typescript
export interface SemanticTokensRegistrationOptions extends
	TextDocumentRegistrationOptions, SemanticTokensOptions,
	StaticRegistrationOptions {
}
```

Since the registration option handles range, full and delta requests the method used to register for semantic tokens requests is `textDocument/semanticTokens` and not one of the specific methods described below.

**Requesting semantic tokens for a whole file**

_Request_:

* method: `textDocument/semanticTokens/full`
* params: `SemanticTokensParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
export interface SemanticTokensParams extends WorkDoneProgressParams,
	PartialResultParams {
	/**
	 * The text document.
	 */
	textDocument: TextDocumentIdentifier;
}
```

_Response_:

* result: `SemanticTokens | null` where `SemanticTokens` is defined as follows:

```typescript
export interface SemanticTokens {
	/**
	 * An optional result id. If provided and clients support delta updating
	 * the client will include the result id in the next semantic token request.
	 * A server can then instead of computing all semantic tokens again simply
	 * send a delta.
	 */
	resultId?: string;

	/**
	 * The actual tokens.
	 */
	data: uinteger[];
}
```

* partial result: `SemanticTokensPartialResult` defines as follows:

```typescript
export interface SemanticTokensPartialResult {
	data: uinteger[];
}
```

* error: code and message set in case an exception happens during the 'textDocument/semanticTokens/full' request

**Requesting semantic token delta for a whole file**

_Request_:

* method: `textDocument/semanticTokens/full/delta`
* params: `SemanticTokensDeltaParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
export interface SemanticTokensDeltaParams extends WorkDoneProgressParams,
	PartialResultParams {
	/**
	 * The text document.
	 */
	textDocument: TextDocumentIdentifier;

	/**
	 * The result id of a previous response. The result Id can either point to
	 * a full response or a delta response depending on what was received last.
	 */
	previousResultId: string;
}
```

_Response_:

* result: `SemanticTokens | SemanticTokensDelta | null` where `SemanticTokensDelta` is defined as follows:

```typescript
export interface SemanticTokensDelta {
	readonly resultId?: string;
	/**
	 * The semantic token edits to transform a previous result into a new
	 * result.
	 */
	edits: SemanticTokensEdit[];
}

export interface SemanticTokensEdit {
	/**
	 * The start offset of the edit.
	 */
	start: uinteger;

	/**
	 * The count of elements to remove.
	 */
	deleteCount: uinteger;

	/**
	 * The elements to insert.
	 */
	data?: uinteger[];
}
```

* partial result: `SemanticTokensDeltaPartialResult` defines as follows:

```typescript
export interface SemanticTokensDeltaPartialResult {
	edits: SemanticTokensEdit[];
}
```

* error: code and message set in case an exception happens during the 'textDocument/semanticTokens/full/delta' request

**Requesting semantic tokens for a range**

When a user opens a file it can be beneficial to only compute the semantic tokens for the visible range (faster rendering of the tokens in the user interface). If a server can compute these tokens faster than for the whole file it can provide a handler for the `textDocument/semanticTokens/range` request to handle this case special. Please note that if a client also announces that it will send the `textDocument/semanticTokens/range` server should implement this request as well to allow for flicker free scrolling and semantic coloring of a minimap.

_Request_:

* method: `textDocument/semanticTokens/range`
* params: `SemanticTokensRangeParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
export interface SemanticTokensRangeParams extends WorkDoneProgressParams,
	PartialResultParams {
	/**
	 * The text document.
	 */
	textDocument: TextDocumentIdentifier;

	/**
	 * The range the semantic tokens are requested for.
	 */
	range: Range;
}
```

_Response_:

* result: `SemanticTokens | null` where `SemanticTokensDelta`
* partial result: `SemanticTokensPartialResult`
* error: code and message set in case an exception happens during the 'textDocument/semanticTokens/range' request

**Requesting a refresh of all semantic tokens**

The `workspace/semanticTokens/refresh` request is sent from the server to the client. Servers can use it to ask clients to refresh the editors for which this server provides semantic tokens. As a result the client should ask the server to recompute the semantic tokens for these editors. This is useful if a server detects a project wide configuration change which requires a re-calculation of all semantic tokens. Note that the client still has the freedom to delay the re-calculation of the semantic tokens if for example an editor is currently not visible.

_Client Capability_:

* property name (optional): `workspace.semanticTokens`
* property type: `SemanticTokensWorkspaceClientCapabilities` defined as follows:

```typescript
export interface SemanticTokensWorkspaceClientCapabilities {
	/**
	 * Whether the client implementation supports a refresh request sent from
	 * the server to the client.
	 *
	 * Note that this event is global and will force the client to refresh all
	 * semantic tokens currently shown. It should be used with absolute care
	 * and is useful for situation where a server for example detect a project
	 * wide change that requires such a calculation.
	 */
	refreshSupport?: boolean;
}
```

_Request_:

* method: `workspace/semanticTokens/refresh`
* params: none

_Response_:

* result: void
* error: code and message set in case an exception happens during the 'workspace/semanticTokens/refresh' request

#### <a href="#textDocument_linkedEditingRange" name="textDocument_linkedEditingRange" class="anchor">Linked Editing Range(:leftwards_arrow_with_hook:)</a>

> *Since version 3.16.0*

The linked editing request is sent from the client to the server to return for a given position in a document the range of the symbol at the position and all ranges that have the same content. Optionally a word pattern can be returned to describe valid contents. A rename to one of the ranges can be applied to all other ranges if the new content is valid. If no result-specific word pattern is provided, the word pattern from the client's language configuration is used.

_Client Capabilities_:

* property name (optional): `textDocument.linkedEditingRange`
* property type: `LinkedEditingRangeClientCapabilities` defined as follows:

```typescript
export interface LinkedEditingRangeClientCapabilities {
	/**
	 * Whether implementation supports dynamic registration.
	 * If this is set to `true` the client supports the new
	 * `(TextDocumentRegistrationOptions & StaticRegistrationOptions)`
	 * return value for the corresponding server capability as well.
	 */
	dynamicRegistration?: boolean;
}
```

_Server Capability_:

#### <a href="#textDocument_moniker" name="textDocument_moniker" class="anchor">Monikers (:leftwards_arrow_with_hook:)</a>

> *Since version 3.16.0*

Language Server Index Format (LSIF) introduced the concept of symbol monikers to help associate symbols across different indexes. This request adds capability for LSP server implementations to provide the same symbol moniker information given a text document position. Clients can utilize this method to get the moniker at the current location in a file user is editing and do further code navigation queries in other services that rely on LSIF indexes and link symbols together.

The `textDocument/moniker` request is sent from the client to the server to get the symbol monikers for a given text document position. An array of Moniker types is returned as response to indicate possible monikers at the given location. If no monikers can be calculated, an empty array or `null` should be returned.

- add support for client feature flags to support that servers can adapt to different client capabilities. An example is the new `textDocument/willSaveWaitUntil` request which not all clients might be able to support. If the feature is disabled in the client capabilities sent on the initialize request, the server can't rely on receiving the request.
- add support to experiment with new features. The new `ClientCapabilities.experimental` section together with feature flags allow servers to provide experimental feature without the need of ALL clients to adopt them immediately.
- servers can more dynamically react to client features. Capabilities can now be registered and unregistered after the initialize request using the new `client/registerCapability` and `client/unregisterCapability`. This for example allows servers to react to settings or configuration changes without a restart.
- add support for `textDocument/willSave` notification and `textDocument/willSaveWaitUntil` request.
- add support for `textDocument/documentLink` request.
- add a `rootUri` property to the initializeParams in favor of the `rootPath` property.
